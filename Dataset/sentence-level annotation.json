The world No 4 is into the semi-finals of the Miami Open , but not before getting a scare from 21 year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem , who pushed him to 4-4 in the second set before going down 3-6 6-4 , 6-1 in an hour and three quarters . Murray was awaiting the winner from the last eight match between Tomas Berdych and Argentina 's Juan Monaco . Prior to this tournament Thiem lost in the second round of a Challenger event to soon-to-be new Brit Aljaz Bedene . Andy Murray pumps his first after defeating Dominic Thiem to reach the Miami Open semi finals . Muray throws his sweatband into the crowd after completing a 3-6 , 6-4 , 6-1 victory in Florida . Murray shakes hands with Thiem who he described as a 'strong guy ' after the game . And Murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow British tennis players who might be agitated about his imminent arrival into the home ranks : do n't complain . Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world number 83 , originally from Slovenia , as motivation to better themselves . At present any grumbles are happening in private , and Bedene 's present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue , although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation . Murray thinks anyone questioning the move , now it has become official , would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his . 'If he was 500 in the world they would n't be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit , ' said the 27 year-old Scot . ' and he 's obviously the British number two , comfortably . 'So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is , and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not . He 's British now so they 've just got to deal with it . Murray stretches for a return after starting his quarter final match slowly on the show court . Thiem held nothing back as he raced through the opening set , winning it 6-3 with a single break . The young Austrian is considered to be one of the hottest prospects on the ATP Tour . ' I would hope that all the guys who are below him now like James ( Ward ) , Kyle ( Edmund ) , Liam ( Broady ) they will use it as motivation . If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup then those guys are going to have to prove themselves . 'It can only be seen as a positive for those guys using it to try to get better . He 's a good player but so are James and Kyle and Liam has improved . Aljaz is there , he 's on the tour every week , the other guys are n't quite there yet . ' For the first time Murray , who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100 , gave his opinion of Bedene : 'He 's a good player with a very good serve . He 's a legitimate top 100 player , when he plays Challengers he 's there or thereabouts , when he plays on the main tour he wins matches , it 's not like he turns up and always loses in the first round . Murray 's fiancee was once again watching from the stands shaded by a huge brimmed hat . Kim Sears flashes her enormous diamond engagement ring while watching her beau on court . 'He had a bad injury last year ( wrist ) but has recovered well . I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings although I do n't know exactly how high he can go . I 've practised with him a couple of times , I have n't seen him play loads , but when you serve as well as he does it helps . I would imagine he ' s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while . ' It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give background support to his case regarding the Davis Cup but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way . An official statement said : 'To have another player in the men 's top 100 is clearly a positive thing for British tennis and so we very much welcome Aljaz 's change in citizenship . ' The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada . It was by no means universally popular but , like Bedene , he pledged that he was in for the long haul and , in fairness to him , he proved true to his word . Loising the first set shocked Murray into life as he raced to a commanding lead in the second . The No 3 seed sent over a few glaring looks towards his team before winning the second set . Murray had to put such matters aside as he tackled the unusually talented Thiem , a delight to watch . Coached by Boris Becker 's veteran mentor Gunter Bresnik , he slightly resembles Andy Roddick and hits with similar power but more elegance . His single handed backhand is a thing of rare beauty . However , he has had a mediocre season coming into this event and there was little to forewarn of his glorious shotmaking that seemed to catch Murray unawares early on . The world No 4 looked to have worked him out in the second , but then suffered one of his periopdic mental lapses and let him back in from 4-1 before closing it out with a break .

        "premise": "As blockchain companies have lost the spotlight this year to the burgeoning, hot world of crypto assets, two of the enterprise blockchain leaders, R3 and Ripple, are now embroiled in a dispute over the cryptocurrency XRP. On Friday, in the Delaware Chancery Court, R3, a consortium of more than 80 financial institutions across the world, sued its partner Ripple, over an options contract to buy more than $1 billion worth of XRP. The same day, in a California state court in San Francisco, Ripple countersued. R3 says in its lawsuit that in September 2016, the companies entered into an agreement, part of which gave R3 the option to purchase 5 billion XRP at an exercise price of $0.0085 between then and September 2019. After soaring more than 3,000% this year, XRP now trades at more than $0.20, making the options worth more than $1 billion. San Francisco-based Ripple uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to make international wire transfers and other forms of cross-border exchange faster and cheaper. New York-based R3 uses similar technology, a distributed ledger which does not use cryptocurrency, as well as its consortium of financial institutions to make multiple banking functions more efficient. The R3 suit claims that, in June 2017, Ripple's current CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emailed R3 CEO David Rutter to terminate the option contracts and asks the court to reinstate the rights granted in it. In its suit, Ripple claims that R3 misled Ripple into entering into partnership agreements, signed in 2016, in which Ripple would benefit from R3's banking partnerships, while R3 would gain not only from the options but also a share of 15% of the revenue Ripple received from any bank participating in their commercial partnership. It alleges that after signing, R3 instead focused its efforts on fundraising. (In May of this year, R3 announced it raised $107 million.) Ripple also alleges that, prior to signing, R3 touted the membership of partners like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who left the consortium after the contract with Ripple was signed. It asks that the court invalidate its agreements and for R3 to pay damages from the breach of its agreement with Ripple in an amount to be determined at trial. \u201cR3 does not discuss the details of pending litigation. We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter,\u201d said R3 in a written statement. A Ripple spokesperson wrote, \"Our filing is straightforward -- R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP\u2019s ~4000% increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement.\" R3 has raised $107 million from its consortium banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, HSBC, and Wells Fargo. Ripple has raised $94 million from Andreessen Horowitz, IDG Capital Partners, Santander Innoventures, SBI Investment, Seagate Technology and others. The market capitalization or network value of XRP has skyrocketed this year from $236 million to $8 billion as of Friday. Ripple is believed to own about 60% of XRP in existence.",

Fresh water is not secure in 20 years\u2019 time unless we organise things differently \u201cWhen we think of the wildfires in California and the wildfires in Portugal, we realise this is exactly what was predicted by climate scientists \u2014 and exactly what was predicted by climate scientists for Spain,\u201d Ms Ribera says. \u201cThis is terrifying for us.\u201d Some of Spain\u2019s agricultural lands also risk turning into desert as the continent heats up and water becomes more scarce, she adds. \u201cFresh water is not secure in 20 years\u2019 time unless we organise things differently.\u201d The new plan, called the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law, sets out sweeping targets for how to wean the Spanish economy off fossil fuels, while also providing financial support and training to people whose jobs could be threatened by the change. However the law must still be approved by parliament, where it could face opposition from those who want a more gradual transition away from fossil fuels. Under the government proposal, no more new licences for oil and gas exploration in Spanish waters will be issued and the country will stop all drilling completely by 2040. Cars fuelled by petrol or diesel will be phased out, and after 2040 only electric and other \u201czero emission\u201d vehicles will be sold in Spain. To shift the electricity system away from fossil fuels, the government plans to start competitive tenders for 3,000MW of renewable power a year. Developing more energy storage will also be essential. \u201cStorage will be key in the energy transition,\u201d says Ms Ribera. Using water reservoirs and hydropower facilities to store energy, for example, by pumping water uphill on a sunny day when solar power is abundant, is one area of more potential. \u201cWe want to test to what extent some share of the hydropower plays the function of storage,\u201d she says. The new policy heralds such a big change because renewables have had a troubled history in the country, observers note. For years, Spain was considered a classic example of how renewable energy policies could go wrong. The country launched generous subsidies for wind and solar starting in 2004 but abruptly halted these payments after the financial crisis. The steep subsidy cuts applied to projects that had already been built, which meant financial ruin for many of Spain\u2019s biggest solar investors. A series of legal cases suing the government for withdrawing subsidies are still working their way through the courts. One of the core goals of the new plan is to give new confidence to investors, says Ms Ribera. \u201cWe need to be consistent, we need to facilitate the good decisions for investment that are needed in the years to come,\u201d she says. The plan has provoked some opposition. Anfac, an association which represents the Spanish automotive industry, has called for the rejection of the planned legislation which it says is \u201cexcessive in its objectives\u201d. Some companies have welcomed the new deal, however. The head of Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, points out that more than \u20ac100bn of investment will be required to meet the new energy goals, much of which will go to wind, solar and hydropower. \u201cFighting climate change is a global task that has to be tackled urgently,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Gal\u00e1n, chairman and chief executive of Iberdrola. \u201cThe EU has been leading this effort for decades. Now Spain is playing its part.\u201d A big difference from the last clean energy push is that subsidies are no longer needed for new solar to compete on cost with traditional power sources, says Meike Becker, an analyst at Bernstein. \u201cThis new solar boom is going to be completely different,\u201d says Ms Becker. \u201cThis is really the return to growth in renewables,\u201d she says, forecasting that 30GW-40GW of new solar power will be installed in Spain between now and 2030. Solar companies were quick to respond to the new government plan. Lightsource BP, a solar developer based in London, announced in November that it was opening an office in Madrid. \u201cI think Spain is a really interesting market,\u201d says Nick Boyle, chief executive, pointing out that Spain\u2019s potential solar resources are twice those of the UK. The possibility of generating power in Spain that could be exported to the rest of Europe through interconnectors is particularly attractive, he says. \u201cIf you think about the grid in Europe, and you think about generating electricity in Spain to supply to Germany or wherever, that is an amazingly exciting thing to be able to do.\u201d",

        "premise": "NEC Corporation announced on Monday that it has partnered with major Taiwanese bank E.Sun to create ATMs that allow customers to make cash withdrawals through facial recognition. The use of facial recognition in E.Sun's ATMS is touted as a world first, and will allow customers to withdraw cash from ATMs via facial recognition and PIN authentication after they have performed the initial setup process. According to NEC, to set up facial recognition cash withdrawals, customers first insert their cash cards and have a photo of their face taken with a camera installed within the ATM. They are then sent a one-time password to their mobile phone that is to be entered into the ATM within a minute, which will register their facial image. The system provided by NEC uses NeoFace, its flagship facial recognition artificial intelligence (AI) engine. \"NEC focuses on the Social Solutions Business, and we will make use of this achievement to realise a safe and secure society,\" said NEC general manager of Safe City Solutions Takashi Yoshida. The facial recognition-enabled ATMs have already been installed and are available for use in five locations around Taiwan, NEC said. It follows NEC installing facial recognition technology at Narita International Airport in Japan, with the \"electronic procedure gate\" installed at the customs inspection area that passengers move through after being admitted through immigration. NEC has also rolled out a network of 400 cameras with facial recognition capabilities to Georgia, and picked up a spate of contracts including the South Australia Police, Northern Territory Police, and CrimTrac that see the company offer up biometric capabilities. The Japanese conglomerate also announced trialling a new adaptive network control technology last week in its mobile edge computing (MEC) servers and base stations that it said will improve the safety of automated driving The trial technology preferentially assigns radio resources to automated vehicles with high urgency, and was able to communicate warning information to vehicles within 100 milliseconds. The allocation of radio resources was based on an analysis of vehicle location information, camera images of the area around the road, and other data, the company explained. NEC conducted the trial at a simulated intersection within an anechoic chamber -- a room designed to completely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. A MEC server, embedded with the trial technology, was able to detect pedestrians by analysing images of street cameras at the intersection, collect information on the location of surrounding vehicles, and shared such information with individual vehicles in real time. A commercial LTE base station was also placed near the intersection, and preferentially allocated radio resources to devices with high urgency in response to the requirements of a Context-aware Service Controller (CSC). As the trial was being conducted, multiple devices such as vehicle models, cameras, and smartphones, were connected to create a situation where there was a shortage of wireless resources. Radio resources were preferentially allocated to vehicles that had approached pedestrians and vehicles who were crossing intersections, and delivered warning information within 100 milliseconds. NEC has also been demonstrating its base station radio units during Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona, after last month partnering with Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo to use 5G to live stream 8K footage into a train. The base station radio units are small, low-power units \"ideal for 5G conditions\", according to NEC. Too many false alarms for population-wide facial surveillance: NEC While NEC continues to roll out facial recognition systems around the world, the company says the spectre of real-time surveillance is a non-starter.

        "premise": "Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez on Wednesday as the former captain of the vessel surrendered to authorities in New York to face criminal charges in the massive oil spill. Joseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York City and hours later Judge Kenneth Rohl set bail at $500,000 -- 10 times what Alaskan authorities had sought. Hazelwood's lawyer said he had not decided whether to waive extradition proceedings and return to Alaska to face the charges; Hazelwood was not required to enter a plea Wednesday. Fired by Exxon After the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, Hazelwood was found to be legally drunk and was fired by Exxon. Hazelwood left Alaska before local authorities could interview him, and had been pursued since Saturday on a fugitive warrant on three misdemeanor charges: operating a watercraft while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil at sea. Together, those three charges have a maximum penalty of 27 months in prison and a $10,000 fine. \"These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at least in this country,\" Rohl said. \"We have a man-made destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.\" FBI officials in Washington say they also are investigating whether Hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. No people have been killed or even seriously injured by the spill, but oil has seriously disrupted the rich Prince William Sound fishing industry. Also, animal-rescue teams estimate the spill has killed several thousand birds and hundreds of sea otters. Estimates of wildlife deaths are not easy to make because oiled birds are hard to spot from the air, and many beaches are difficult to reach for in person inspections. In the wildlife-rich sound, cleanup crews continued to skim emulsified oil as thick as pudding. As of Wednesday, 12 days after the Exxon Valdez ran aground, the 240,000-barrel slick was estimated to affect an area the size of Delaware, and Exxon's fleet of oil-skimming boats had picked up only about 5% of the spilled oil. The state of Alaska condemned Exxon's cleanup on Wednesday and asked the Coast Guard to take over the effort. Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), a senior member of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee added during a tour of Prince William Sound that fraud \"is not too strong a word to describe Exxon's cleanup claims.\" \"What they are really doing is managing the failure,\" Miller said after meeting with Aleut Indian residents in the tiny fishing village of Chenega Bay. Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle coordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which he said was too bureaucratic. \"Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a military system to get things done,\" the governor said. Although Cowper said he did not want to be \"extremely critical\" of Exxon, a letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental official said Exxon had been unresponsive. \"Exxon has failed to provide . . . the information necessary to make sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protection of resources,\" wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the state Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Response Section. President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials to Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup was not necessary. Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr., commander of the Coast Guard's 17th District in Juneau had no immediate reply to Cowper's request. Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with charges it was not handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon was the best organization to manage the effort. \"We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. We think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this project is (for Exxon) to continue,\" Beathard said. The tanker refloat went unexpectedly well. The 987-foot ship lifted off the reef three hours earlier than the Exxon salvage crew predicted, proceeding without problem under close watch of a flotilla of six tugs and other support craft, including the Coast Guard Cutter Rush, to a cove on uninhabited Naked Island 25 miles to the southwest, where repairs will be made. Even though a relatively well-known salvage technique was used to float the Valdez -- using compressed air to force water out of the ruptured hold and thus assist high tide in lifting the vessel off the rocks -- \"we couldn't predict this by the exact hour or minute,\" said salvage coordinator Gary Gorski, who supervised from the ferry Glacier Queen II. Almost 1 million barrels of oil were pumped from the Exxon Valdez to three smaller tankers over the last 11 days, and the salvage process began as soon as the last of the tankers left for Southern California refineries on Tuesday. The ship was made airtight above the water line, and then, on Wednesday, compressed air was forced inside. The air forced out some of the 998,000 barrels of sea water that had been pumped into the stricken tanker as oil was removed. Naval architect Richard Smith, hired by Exxon, estimated before the refloat that the pressure would force enough water out of the hull to lift the ship at least three feet. He added that this technique also would produce a pressurized buffer of clean sea water between the oil left in the tanker -- about 15,000 to 20,000 barrels -- and the once-pristine waters off Valdez. Even so, Exxon officials warned in advance that refloating the ship could uncover additional oil that had been pinned in pockets between the ship's hull and rocky Bligh Reef. The Port of Valdez was closed at 10 a.m. to clear the iceberg-dotted waters of other vessels as the refloating was attempted and Coast Guard spokesman Bruce Pimental said that the vital oil terminal would remain closed until the stricken tanker was safely anchored. However, flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily flow of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said. Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60% because the spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but traffic has increased. Gorski said that the ease with which the refloat was accomplished may indicate that the damage, while severe, may not be as bad as earlier feared. Exxon officials were reluctant to estimate how long temporary repairs would take or discuss where the tanker would be taken to permanently patch its hull and rebuild its internal pumping system, which also was compromised in the accident. Portland, Ore., was the company's first choice, but it backed away from that option after Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt and managers of the Port of Portland expressed concern that the Exxon Valdez would still be leaking oil when it arrived there. Already under attack by Gov. Cowper for fouling Prince William Sound, Exxon said it would consider having the tanker repaired in the Far East -- Japan, Korea or Singapore. Even as it made that concession, the company denied its ship would endanger any port it visited for repair. Staff writer Larry B. Stammer in Valdez contributed to this report.",

ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran 's executioners for their work . 'All shots were done perfectly . These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January , ' he said . Scroll down for video . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo ( right ) applauded Chan and Sukumaran 's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo ( second right ) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly ' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning 's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country , as he dismissed Australia 's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction ' . He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday , hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders . ' I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing . It is not a fun job , ' he said . 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs . We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came . What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott 's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . 'Therefore , I would like to offer my condolences , on the execution of those who were on the death row , to their families , to their home countries . 'Once again , we are not against the countries , but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation 's survival . ' Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions as 'cruel and unnecessary ' and announced he would withdraw Australia 's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson . 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past . Brazil has done the same thing , ' he said . ' I think this is just a momentary reaction , and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere . ' Indonesia 's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest . 'Within a month or two , they will come back . That 's the signal of protest , we did that too , ' he said , referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others . 'This is a warning for others , do n't even try to commit these drug crimes , to think a thousand times , that Indonesia will be strict , will be harsh on drug crimes , ' he told reporters in Cilacap . 'The result of the second execution was better , more orderly and more perfect than the last , ' he said , referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely ' this time . Indonesia 's President Joko Widodo raised his nation 's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador . 'Our sovereignty must be respected , ' he told reporters . Rest in peace : Myuran Sukumaran ( foreground ) and Andrew Chan ( back ) were executed . 'We 're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well . ' Mr Abbott announced Australia 's unprecedented diplomatic response on Wednesday morning , just hours after the Bali Nine duo were put to death despite pleas for their deaths to be reconsidered . 'Australia respects the Indonesian system , we respect Indonesia 's sovereignty but we do deplore what 's been done and this can not simply be business as usual , ' Mr Abbott said . 'For that reason once all the courtesies have been extended to the Chan and Sukumaran families our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations . ' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men 's bodies to be repatriated to Australia , ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect ' . 'And I expect to be able to discuss further aspects of our relationship with Indonesia when our ambassador Paul Grigson returns to Australia at the end of this week , ' Ms Bishop said . The consul general Majel Hind will formally identify the bodies . Ms Bishop has n't ruled out cutting Australian aid to Indonesia in protest over the executions of Chan and Sukumaran . Australia 's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop ( left ) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men 's bodies to be repatriated to Australia , ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect ' Australia gives Indonesia about $ 600 million in aid annually , and is its second largest international benefactor behind Japan . Asked if Australia would respond to the executions by reducing the aid budget , Ms Bishop said it was under different consideration to diplomatic actions such as recalling the ambassador . 'Any announcement to the aid budget will be made at budget time in early May , ' she told reporters in Canberra . Mr Abbott stressed that Australia has a 'very important ' relationship with Indonesia . 'But it has suffered as a result of what 's been done over the last few hours , ' he said . 'Whatever people think of the death penalty , whatever people think of drug crime , the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy and I 'm sure that every Australian 's thoughts and prayers will be with those families at this time . ' The Prime Minister said he understood people 's anger at the executions , but said the government did not want to make a difficult situation worse . 'So I would say to people yes , you are absolutely entitled to be angry but we 've got to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse , ' he said . 'The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is important , remains important , will always be important , will become more important as time goes by . 'While this is a dark moment in the relationship I am confident that the relationship will be restored for the great benefit of both our countries . ' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten acknowledged Australians had the right to be outraged but rejected talk of boycotts . ' I do n't and we should n't hold ordinary or individual Indonesian people responsible , '' he said . 'What Australians need to do is campaign against the death penalty wherever it exists . ' Backlash begins : At 6am AEST , hundreds of Twitter users were already pledging to 'boycott Indonesia ' Should Australia respect Indonesia 's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan ? Should Australia respect Indonesia 's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan ? Now share your opinion . The executions by firing squad occurred at 3:25am AEST on Wednesday evening and came despite months of pressure from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop . Senior officials were already angered by a series of snubs from the Indonesians . President Widodo repeatedly refused to return Mr Abbott 's phone calls on the issue . Ms Bishop was also angered by the Indonesians ' decision to announce the executions were going ahead on Anzac Day , one of Australia 's most solemn days of remembrance . The Bali Nine duo 's families released a short statement on Wednesday morning . 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew . Our sons , our brothers . In the 10 years since they were arrested , they did all they could to make amends , helping many others , ' it read . 'They asked for mercy , but there was none . They were immensely grateful for all the support they received . We too , will be forever grateful . ' Following the executions , Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said : 'Indonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system . ' Other Labor MPs condemned the killings , with Opposition frontbencher Tony Burke saying 'Lives lost . Nothing gained ' and Federal Labor MP Anthony Albanese saying 'RIP Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - a tragic loss of human life on a very sad day . ' Greens Leader Christine Milne said : 'The lives of these two Australians have been ended by firing squad at the direction of the Indonesian government . We in Australia must continue to advocate for an end to capital punishment . ' Stern words : Julie Bishop has pleaded for the Indonesian government not to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for months . Joko Widodo , the president of Indonesia , is widely regarded as weak . He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts . Immediately following the executions , parliamentary secretary Steven Ciobo tweeted : 'There are few greater displays of abuse of power and regressive thinking than the death penalty # RIP ' , tweeted . He was joined by western Sydney backbencher Fiona Scott , who said : 'The death penalty is barbaric and inhumane torture . Murder is murder . ' Brazil already recalled its ambassador in January when one of its citizens was executed by Indonesia . But Indonesia forged ahead with more executions overnight , killing six others - including a Frenchman - and shrugging off pressure from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon . There is also the potential for other ramifications from Australia . Top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has suggested Australia could withdraw its $ 600 million of aid to Indonesia per year and redirect it to Nepal . 'Nepal needs it more , ' said Mr Robertson , who accused Indonesia of breaching international law in three instances . Ms Bishop and her Labor counterpart , Tanya Plibersek ( right ) , have been a united force in their opposition to the executions . In an interview with ABC 's 730 program on Tuesday evening , Ms Bishop refused to detail the consequences for the Indonesian government . ' I do n't intend to focus on the consequences , ' she said . 'But of course , should these executions proceed in the manner that I anticipate , of course there will be have to be consequences . I do n't want to go into the details . ' After months of pleading with the Indonesians - even offering a prisoner swap , paid by Australia - officials still worked on Mr Widodo until the last moment . Late on Tuesday evening , the Australian embassy in Jakarta circulated an extraordinary joint statement with the European Union and French government addressed to Mr Widodo . The statement said : 'It is not too late to change your mind . ' But with the exception of Filipino convict Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - who was spared - Mr Widodo did not .",

The number of employees has grown almost eight times over the past year, from 80 to more than 600 now, Pradeep Desu, head of recruitment at Uber India, told TechCircle. The company is looking to fill several vacancies across India this year in functions such as business development, marketing and operations. Uber's India careers page has more than 70 vacancies for Gurgaon, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Guwahati, Pune, Surat and Kolkata. These include head of marketing and head of customer relationship management at the Gurgaon head office. The company is also actively using its own app to look for potential employees. A week ago, whoever opened the Uber app in Mumbai was greeted by a message: \"Want to work with Uber?\" The message said that the company is hiring people \"to shape the future of transportation in Mumbai\". Recently, Uber appointed former journalist Shweta Rajpal Kohli as the head of public policy and government affairs for its India operations. Uber broke convention in June last year when it appointed Amit Jain from Renti.com as president and India head, a first-of-its-kind position in any of its markets. The ride-hailing firm says it is focussing on its business in India, its second-largest market in terms of number of trips taken after the US, following its decision to sell its China operations to local rival Didi Chuxing. In a recent interview to Mint, Uber's Jain said the company had started to divert to India a significant portion of the $1 billion investment it had planned to make in China this year. He also said the company planned to increase the team at its Bengaluru engineering centre to 50 from 15 by the end of the year. Uber is one the most heavily-funded startups in the world. Marquee names such as Fidelity Investments, BlackRock Inc, Kleiner Perkins, Google Ventures, Menlo Ventures, New Enterprise Associates and Qatar Investment Authority have put money in the company. Uber mainly competes with ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which operates Ola, in India. Ola is also beefing up its leadership team. Last week, tech news site FactorDaily reported, citing anonymous sources, that Ola was in talks to hire Mayank Trivedi, Nestle's country manager for Greater China region, for a leadership role, reporting to CEO Bhavish Aggarwal. Ola, however, recently laid off hundreds of employees after shutting down its subsidiary TaxiForSure. Analysts say it is essential for Uber to boost its staff strength to achieve its growth plans and tap into the vast opportunity in India. \"The market potential is huge and that is why they are making strategic investments,\" says Moorthy K Uppaluri, managing director and CEO at recruitment firm Randstad India. Sanjay Modi, managing director at job portal Monster.com's Asia and Middle East business, said that a lack of integrated public transport in India and growing congestion on roads discouraging commuters from self-driven cars are together fueling growth of taxi-hailing aggregators in the country. \"Given this landscape of intense competition, players need to find the right talent fit in order to ride the growth wave,\" Modi said.

        "premise": "Audi has created a so-called 'green ' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide . The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future ' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles . Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude ' , which was then refined into diesel . Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel ( shown above ) made from water and carbon dioxide . Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude ' , which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels , or used as a fuel in its own right . Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka . Reiner Mangold , head of sustainable product development at Audi , said : 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long\u2011distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate . Audi 's fuel was developed with Sunfire , a Dresden-based energy technology company . To make the fuel , water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis . By performing this process at temperatures above 800\u00b0C ( 1,472\u00b0F ) , the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature . The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures . This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons . Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels , but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude ' . Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70 % . The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel . 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany , but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries . ' The new fuel was developed by Audi along with Sunfire , a Dresden-based energy technology company . To make the fuel , water is first heated to form steam , which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis . By performing this process at temperatures above 800\u00b0C ( 1,472\u00b0F ) , the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature .

Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude ' . Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70 per cent . The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel . Water is heated to form steam , which is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis . Hydrogen is pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons , known as 'blue crude ' . Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings \u2013 known as aromatic hydrocarbons \u2013 which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution . A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power . Currently , while hydrogen fuel is appealing , the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy . But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water , meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels . Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel . The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the oxidation half of the reaction . Christian von Olshausen , chief technology officer at Sunfire , said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel . He said : 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created . ' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months . The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct . Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing ' . Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming . By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air , Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere . The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles . Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka . The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane \u2013 for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles . At the launch of the new e-diesel , Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8 . She said : 'This synthetic diesel , made using carbon dioxide , is a huge success for our sustainability research . 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material , we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources , and put the fundamentals of the `` green economy '' in place .

        "premise": "(Reuters) - Several U.S. employers engaged in age discrimination by placing recruitment ads on Facebook targeting younger workers, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by a communications industry labor union. Companies including T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Cox Communications Inc imposed age limits on who could see recruitment ads, limiting some only to people younger than 38, according to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco by the Communications Workers of America. \u201cThis pattern or practice of discrimination denies job opportunities to individuals who are searching for and interested in jobs, reduces the number of older workers who apply for jobs with the offending employers and employment agencies, and depresses the number of older workers who are hired,\u201d the complaint reads. The lawsuit is the latest example of criticism leveled at Facebook for so-called micro-targeting, a process that has allowed advertisers to choose who sees their ads based on age, interests, race and even such characteristics as whether they dislike people based on race or religion. Last month, the company said it was temporarily disabling the ability of advertisers to exclude racial groups from the intended audience of ads, and promised to \u201cdo better\u201d at policing discriminatory practices. Facebook, which is not named as a defendant but is accused in the lawsuit of engaging in the practice in its own recruitment efforts, said in a statement on its website that it does not engage in age discrimination. T-Mobile and Cox said they do not comment on litigation. Amazon said it has corrected some ads. \u201cWe recently audited our recruiting ads on Facebook and discovered some had targeting that was inconsistent with our approach of searching for any candidate over the age of 18,\u201d Amazon said.

Chairman of the High Peace Council Pir Sayed Ahmad Gilani talks to representatives of Hizb-i-Islami in Kabul, Afghanistan March 17, 2016. REUTERS/Mohammad Ismail The announcement marked the first success for the renewed effort, aided by the U.S., China and Pakistan, to end nearly 15 years of war in Afghanistan that kills and maims hundreds of people each month. Representatives of Hizb-i-Islami, an Islamist militant movement of several hundred fighters led by Soviet-era Afghan war hero Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, appeared at a press briefing with members of the High Peace Council, which oversees the peace process. \u201cToday we held our first intra-Afghan dialogue in the presence of High Peace Council leadership,\u201d said Mohammad Ayoub Rafiq, the council\u2019s head of secretariat. \u201cMay God help us to progress on the path of peace.\u201d The head of the Hizb-i-Islami delegation, Karim Amin, said he hoped other anti-government fighters would be inspired by the \u201cselflessness\u201d of his movement and join the process, although there was no mention of the group surrendering arms yet. Loosely allied with the Afghan Taliban, Hizb-i-Islami fighters are believed to be active in Afghanistan\u2019s eastern Kunar, Nuristan, Ghazni and Logar provinces. The movement also has a political party with members in parliament and government, and wields influence because of the fearsome reputation of its founder and leader. Hekmatyar became a hero to many Afghans while leading mujahideen fighters against the Soviet occupation of the country in the 1980s. A former Afghan prime minister, he took up arms against the new government in Kabul after the 2001 U.S.-sponsored toppling of the Taliban\u2019s hardline Islamist regime. Hekmatyar left Afghanistan in the mid-1990s and is believed to be in Pakistan, although his exact location is unknown. Small groups of Hizb-i-Islami have defected to Afghanistan\u2019s government in the past, but the main leadership\u2019s decision to join formal peace talks marked a milestone for the process. The Taliban\u2019s leadership, however, earlier this month rejected an invitation to join direct talks with the Afghan government in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. Though it is one of several armed anti-government factions and its own leadership is fractured, the Taliban are responsible for most of the attacks in Afghanistan. The movement intensified its offensive last year, the first in which Afghanistan\u2019s armed forces and police were fighting without NATO combat troops who withdrew at the end of 2014. In October, the Taliban captured the northern provincial capital of Kunduz, the first major city to fall to the insurgents since 2001. Afghan forces backed by U.S. air power took back the city after a week of intense fighting. Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Mike Collett-White",

        "premise": "Frozen salt and vinegar crisp , anyone ? We all know freezing is a great way of preserving foods . But believe it or not , the process can make some things taste even better . From cakes to curries , freezing brings out more of their flavour and boosts the texture . Here , Tessa Cunningham puts a host of our favourite foods to the frozen test . . . CAKES . If you think nothing beats the gooey deliciousness of a home-made cake fresh from the oven , think again . Resist the temptation to cut that first slice straight away and , instead , put your cake into the freezer . Scroll down for video . The gooey deliciousness of a cake fresh out of the oven is unbeatable but they can dry out and get stale very quickly . Freeze your cake for 24 hours straight from the oven and the sponge will be bouncier than ever . After being frozen for 24 hours , the sponge will be even bouncier because this process boosts the moisture , so you get an even creamier and softer centre . Let your cake cool entirely , then put it into the freezer without a wrapping . Once frozen solid , wrap it in clingfilm , and it can be kept frozen for up to three months . When you are ready to tuck in , defrost for up to three hours , until thawed . HERBS AND SPICES . Keeping fresh herbs in the freezer will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process . Once defrosted , it also makes them softer , so all their lovely juices seep out more readily and the flavours are more potent . Tough herbs such as rosemary and thyme preserve the best , but ginger , lemongrass , garlic and chilli will last up to six months when frozen . By keeping fresh herbs in the freezer you will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process . Just pop stems in a plastic container and freeze . You can sprinkle frozen chilli , garlic and ginger into stews , fishcakes or curries . Frozen herbs are also brilliant in pies , pasta and pestos . You can even freeze them in ice cube trays with a drizzle of water . That way , they can go straight into a stew or soup \u2014 no defrosting needed . CRISPS . Left out for just a few hours , crisps will start going stale and soggy . But even wrapping left-overs in clingfilm to seal out the oxygen won \u2019 t keep them super crunchy . Crisps have a tendency to go stale and soggy once they have been left out for a few hours but this problem can be solved if you simply pop them in an airtight back and put them in the freezer . So if you \u2019 ve ever found yourself scoffing a big bag just so that they aren \u2019 t wasted , stop right now . Pop the crisps in an airtight bag and place them in the freezer . They will stay fresh for at least two months . By extracting air , freezing makes the crisps crunchier and they can even be eaten straight from frozen . NUTS . Once you open a bag of nuts , the clock starts ticking . As nuts have a high oil content , they go rancid very quickly . Now , you have a solution \u2014 freezing will preserve the flavour and texture instantly . Due to the high oil content of nuts , they go rancid very quickly but freezing them will preserve the flavour and texture right away . To freeze peanuts , walnuts , pecans , macadamias , cashews , hazelnuts and almonds ( shelled or unshelled ) , wrap them in clingfilm , then place them in a resealable bag . They will keep for up to a year and , when you want to eat them , they \u2019 ll defrost in less than an hour . TOMATOES . Fed up with struggling to peel the skins off tomatoes ? Freeze them first then , once thawed for two hours , the skin will come off easily . That \u2019 s because the freezing process loosens the skins . While you probably won \u2019 t want to use frozen tomatoes in salads , as it makes the flesh slightly squishy , it does intensify the flavour . Peeling the skin off tomatoes can be really tricky , but if you freeze them and let them thaw for a couple of hours the skin will come off much more easily . So , once defrosted , you can use your tomatoes to make richer sauces for pasta and stews , or as a topping for pizzas . Alternatively , before freezing , roast your tomatoes at a gentle temperature with garlic , fresh herbs and a drizzle of olive oil for up to four hours . When cooled , transfer them to freezer bags . Use in chilli or home-made tomato sauces . CURRY . Curries don \u2019 t only have to be enjoyed the first time round \u2014 you can freeze the leftovers and reheat when needed . Freezing a curry is a great way to make the most of leftovers especially because as the curry cools the flavours and aromas combine to create even better seasoning . And hey presto ! , they taste even yummier . That \u2019 s because , as the curry cools , the flavour and aroma compounds mingle together , developing more seasoned notes . The individual flavours you tasted the first time around , such as cinnamon , garlic and nutmeg , are still there . But the effect is more mellow . RASPBERRIES . Frozen raspberries are great scattered on muesli , added to ice cream or whizzed in smoothies . While freezing may make the berries a bit softer , it accentuates their sharp , fresh flavour , too . Frozen raspeberries can be delicious when sprinkled through muesli , added to ice cream or whizzed into a tasty fruit smoothie . Place your berries in a single layer on a baking tray and put the tray in the freezer . Once they are frozen , you can put them into an airtight bag or plastic container and store in the freezer . They will stay good for up to a year . BANANAS . Fancy a healthy , guilt-free ice cream ? Then tuck into a frozen banana after dinner . Bananas have a high pectin content , which gives them a creamy , rich texture when frozen \u2014 just like ice cream . When bananas are frozen they adopt a creamy , rich texture which makes them a great guilt-free ice cream . To freeze , peel a ripe banana and chop into thin slices . Put into an airtight container and freeze until solid ( around two hours ) . Decant the slices into a blender or food processor and whizz . In seconds , your frozen banana will look just like ice cream and taste every bit as yummy . Scoop into a bowl and enjoy . For an indulgent treat , add chocolate chips or nut flakes .",

        "premise": "Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets. Officials said 566 Gila trout were fished out of Diamond Creek in southwestern New Mexico, put in containers on mules and horses, loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery. The trout will stay there until the creek rises and becomes ash-free. ``They were in good shape,'' said Toby Martinez, a U.S. Forest Service range and wildlife staff officer for the Gila National Forest. Officials hoped at least 90 percent would survive. Much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning-caused Divide fire, which started June 30 and burned about 10,000 acres 150 miles southwest of Albuquerque, said Forest Service spokeswoman Andrea Garcia. The fire was contained Monday and should be controlled within four days, Ms. Garcia said. Martinez said rescuers used electric shockers to stun the fish, then netted them. When a fish is stunned, it comes to the surface. Gila trout once were widespread throughout mountain streams in the Gila River Basin of southwestern New Mexico, but the habitat was ruined because of wood cutting, overgrazing and irrigation. The trout was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1967. Lightning sparked three small fires Thursday and today, but firefighters were extinguishing them today, said Willie Zapata, U.S. Forest Service dispatcher in Gila. In California, 1,500 firefighters aided by light wind and higher humidity Thursday had circled 70 percent of an arson fire that has charred more than 3,000 acres of scenic California coastline near Big Sur. Firefighters said they were unable to make progress overnight. They hoped to have the 6-day-old fire contained by late today, but authorities were concerned that higher temperatures could hamper their efforts. A brush fire accidentally started by Marine Corps tracer fire continued burning out of control today after charring at least 3,000 acres at Camp Pendleton, a base spokesman said. Firefighters on Thursday said they had contained the 2,000-acre Livermore Fire west of Fort Collins, Colo., in Roosevelt National Forest, the last of three major fires in Colorado to be encircled by firefighters. Seven 20-person crews fighting the fire were to be reduced to three crews, officials said. Earlier, firefighters contained the Black Tiger fire which covered 2,000 acres in Boulder Canyon and destroyed dozens of homes, and halted a 2,600-acre fire in Mesa Verde National Monument in southwestern Colorado. Arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires, and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained. The stubborn Horton Fire, burning beneath the Mogollon Rim, had grown to 300 acres, but officials expected to have it contained by late Saturday. In northwest Nebraska, members of a volunteer fire department and a few National Guardsmen stood by the smoldering remains of a blaze that charred 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge. The fire, which raged for four days and destroyed 14 unoccupied structures, was contained Wednesday and officials predicted it would be controlled soon. Forest officials in Nebraska shifted their attention Thursday from firefighting to seeding grass and planting trees. The blaze blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years old, said U.S. Forest Service Fire Staff Officer Jim Carson. Carson hoped for rain. ``My experience is that we'd see green grass again if we get enough moisture, say a half-inch of rain,'' he said. Rains helped firefighters in western Wyoming forests. The storms dampened a fire in Bridger-Teton National Forest that had burned nearly 3,500 acres. ``It's been real quiet,'' said Dick Heninger, a ranger in the forest's Pinedale office. ``It looks better all the time, the way these clouds are coming in.'' Heninger said four crews will probably be released from the fire today, leaving two to continue mop-up work. But one official with the Wyoming Interagency Fire Coordination Center warned the break in the fire season will probably be short-lived. ``As soon as it gets hot and dry again, we will be right back in it,'' said center spokesman Greg Warner. ``For now, anyway, we are getting some relief.''",

According to GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association\u2019s newly released U.S. Energy Storage Monitor 2017 Year in Review, 100 megawatt-hours of grid-connected energy storage were deployed in the fourth quarter of the year, marking 1,080 cumulative megawatt-hours deployed between 2013 and 2017. Even more impressive, GTM Research expects that the U.S. market will almost double this total in 2018 alone, with more than 1,000 megawatt-hours of energy storage forecast to be deployed this year. Source: GTM Research / ESA U.S. Energy Storage Monitor \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to strike the word \u2018nascent\u2019 from our vocabularies when describing the U.S. energy storage market,\u201d said Ravi Manghani, GTM Research\u2019s director of energy storage. \u201cFalling costs and favorable policies will be among the core drivers of the market\u2019s breakout 2018. It's not hard to imagine that every solar RFP by the end of the year will include storage.\u201d \u200b \u201cThe recent unanimous landmark decision issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to lay the groundwork for the integration of energy storage technologies into the U.S. wholesale markets in a manner that compensates storage for the full range of value it is already capable of providing to the grid and end users,\u201d said Kelly Speakes-Backman, CEO of ESA. \u201cPolicies and regulatory frameworks that level the playing field will further encourage energy storage deployment throughout 2018 and beyond as the industry builds toward a goal of realizing 35 GW by 2025.\u201d The U.S. energy storage market grew 27 percent in 2017, with 431 megawatt-hours deployed on the year. While the front-of-meter market made up the largest share of deployments, it was the behind-the-meter market that stole the show this year, growing 79 percent year-over-year with record deployments in both the residential and non-residential segments. 2017 U.S. Energy Storage Scorecard Source: GTM Research / ESA U.S. Energy Storage Monitor According to the report, California led the way in the behind-the-meter market, thanks in large part to its Self-Generation Incentive Program, while other markets such as Hawaii, Massachusetts and New York saw strong growth as well. The report notes that the front-of-meter market was up 19 percent quarter-over-quarter thanks to longer-duration systems in North Carolina. In fact, GTM Research and ESA highlighted an emerging trend toward longer average discharge durations, leading to greater growth in megawatt-hour terms. While several major projects slipped from the fourth quarter of 2017 into 2018, the front-of-meter segment was still up 10 percent annually in megawatt-hour terms on the year. The end of 2017 saw discussions of the Section 201 solar trade case, which ultimately led to a decision by the Trump administration in January 2018 to impose tariffs on imported solar cells and modules. Though the tariffs are specific to solar technology, there are implications for the energy storage market. GTM Research expects the market to feel the impact of the tariffs most heavily in 2019 for both solar and storage. However, the U.S. storage market will be somewhat insulated thanks to standalone storage applications and solar developers seeing storage as a value-add for their business. According to the report, the annual value of the U.S. energy storage market will exceed $1.2 billion in 2019. Key findings from the report include: *** Want more insight?

Knowing that the seven-year wait might be too long , PJ , a self-employed musician , submitted himself for the weeks-long evaluation to assess whether he could donate his kidney . Journey : For a year , he kept losing weight and going in for tests , only to be told he needed to lose more . Finally , he visited Nashville 's Vanderbilt hospital in December 2014 , and the numbers all matched up . However , the good news was tinged with disappointment as doctors said his size meant the operation could n't go ahead . 'They said I was a perfect match but they wanted to check I was healthy and met their requirements . They sent me a blood pressure monitor , but they did n't like the numbers . 'That was a real kick in the gut . ' The doctors advised PJ , who weighed 265lbs , to lose 30lbs before returning for an evaluation . He did - but on the day of the test he changed a flat tire .

        "premise": "The Japanese lettuce production company Spread believes the farmers of the future will be robots. So much so that Spread is creating the world's first farm manned entirely by robots. Instead of relying on human farmers, the indoor Vegetable Factory will employ robots that can harvest 30,000 heads of lettuce every day. Don't expect a bunch of humanoid robots to roam the halls, however; the robots look more like conveyor belts with arms. They'll plant seeds, water plants, and trim lettuce heads after harvest in the Kyoto, Japan farm. \"The use of machines and technology has been improving agriculture in this way throughout human history,\" J.J. Price, a spokesperson at Spread, tells Tech Insider. \"With the introduction of plant factories and their controlled environment, we are now able to provide the ideal environment for the crops.\" The Vegetable Factory follows the growing agricultural trend of vertical farming, where farmers grow crops indoors without natural sunlight. Instead, they rely on LED light and grow crops on racks that stack on top of each other. In addition to increasing production and reducing waste, indoor vertical farming also eliminates runoff from pesticides and herbicides \u2014 chemicals used in traditional outdoor farming that can be harmful to the environment. The new farm, set to open in 2017, will be an upgrade to Spread's existing indoor farm, the Kameoka Plant. That farm currently produces about 21,000 heads of lettuce per day with help from a small staff of humans. Spread's new automation technology will not only produce more lettuce, it will also reduce labor costs by 50%, cut energy use by 30%, and recycle 98% of water needed to grow the crops. The resulting increase in revenue and resources could cut costs for consumers, Price says. \"Our mission is to help create a sustainable society where future generations will not have to worry about food security and food safety,\" Price says. \"This means that we will have to make it affordable for everyone and begin to grow staple crops and plant protein to make a real difference.\" Spread is also developing sensors to provide data about how specific type of crops grow. These sensors would alert human workers if a crop is not growing correctly, allowing them to adjust techniques as necessary. Farm robots will certainly eliminate some human jobs, but they could also create new and more interesting jobs for people. Spread's human farmers, for example, will be able to concentrate on developing sustainable farming methods and learning how to produce higher quality vegetables. The Vegetable Factory will open next year, and eventually, Spreadhopes to build similar robot farms around the world.",

Whiplash claims cost the motor insurance industry \u00a32bn a year, but new legislation will \u201censure spurious or exaggerated whiplash claims are no longer an easy payday\u201d, according to the Ministry of Justice. The legislation, which has received royal assent, will not come into force until April 2020 but according to Comparethemarket, insurers have already started to reduce premiums in anticipation of lower payouts.

Comparethemarket said the average car insurance premium in December last year was \u00a3790 but has since fallen to \u00a3690. The Civil Liability Act was passed in December and will change the way whiplash claims are calculated. As part of the bill, the government also agreed to reform the rates used to calculate large payouts in serious personal injury claims, otherwise known as the Ogden rate.

        "premise": "( CNN ) Remember the Tuskegee syphilis experiment from the 1930s ? Scientists studied poor African-Americans in Alabama who 'd contracted the venereal disease but did n't tell them they had the disease or do anything to cure them . A lawsuit filed this week alleges Johns Hopkins University and the Rockefeller Foundation helped conduct a similar study in Guatemala from 1945 to 1956 . Orphans , inmates , psychiatric patients and prostitutes were deliberately infected with sexually transmitted diseases to determine what drugs , including penicillin , worked best in stopping the diseases , the lawsuit says . The subjects of the experiments were n't told they 'd been infected , the lawsuit says , causing some to die and others to pass the disease to their spouses , sexual partners and children . The suit seeks more than $ 1 billion in damages and has 774 plaintiffs , including people who were subjects in the experiments and their descendants . This is the second attempt to collect damages . In 2012 , a class-action federal lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government over the Guatemala experiments conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service . A judge dismissed it , saying the Guatemalans could not sue the United States for grievances that happened overseas . The new lawsuit was filed in the Baltimore City Circuit Court . Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation filed statements on their websites condemning the experiments , but denying responsibility . `` The plaintiffs ' essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members ' participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable , '' the Johns Hopkins statement said . `` Neither assertion is true . '' The lawsuit alleges the Rockefeller Foundation funded Johns Hopkins ' research into public health issues , including venereal disease , and employed scientists who monitored the Guatemala experiments . The lawsuit , the Rockefeller Foundation statement said , `` seeks improperly to assign 'guilt by association ' in the absence of compensation from the United States federal government . '' The suit says Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation designed , supported and benefited from the Guatemala experiments . Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical group and that company 's owner , Mead Johnson , also are defendants . The pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments , the suit says . On Saturday , a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb sent this statement to CNN : `` We 've only just received the complaint in this matter . Bristol-Myers Squibb played an important role in the development of penicillin in the past and today we continue to focus our work on developing breakthrough medicines for serious disease . As a company dedicated to patients , we take this matter very seriously and are reviewing the allegations . '' Nobody doubts the experiments happened . In 2010 , then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized to Guatemala for the experiments , saying they were `` clearly unethical . '' In the 1930s and 1940s , the government followed a policy of funding scientific medical research but not controlling individual doctors , the suit says . The lawsuit says John Hopkins controlled and influenced the appointed panels that authorized funding for research into venereal disease . The lawsuit says prostitutes were infected to intentionally spread the disease and that syphilis spirochetes were injected into the spinal fluid of subjects . A woman in a psychiatric hospital had gonorrhea pus from a male subject injected into both her eyes , the suit says . The lawsuit does n't say why the experiments ended . The results were never published and were not revealed until 2011 , when the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues wrote a letter to President Barack Obama telling of its investigation , the suit says .

        "premise": "The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has proposed to grant the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) electricity trading license in India. The license is to be granted to help the NTPC in implementing renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind energy projects across the country. NTPC had petitioned the CERC seeking a grant of Category `I` license for inter-state trading in electricity in all states and Union Territories of India. In its petition, NTPC had submitted that it had been asked by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) to implement 15 GW of solar PV projects. NTPC had expressed that trading license would help in setting up this capacity. NTPC had stated that being an intermediary procurer, NTPC would be required to aggregate the solar power purchased from different solar power generators and sell it to the distribution licensee/company (DISCOM). In such cases, the intermediary procurer will be playing the role of a trader, namely buying power from the developers and selling the same to one or more DISCOM. After going through submissions made as part of the petition, CERC observed that NTPC had set a target of achieving 32 GW of renewable energy-based capacity by 2032 out of which 30 GW is expected to be solar PV. Under the initiative of MNRE for procurement of 20,000 MW, NTPC has been identified as the nodal agency. As part of this plan, NTPC has selected the wind/solar power project developers for implementation of wind/solar PV projects and procurement of cumulative capacity of 1,150 MW wind power and 2,000 MW solar PV. NTPCs presence as an intermediary agency has led to the assurance of timely payment to renewable energy developers, which has resulted in low tariffs for wind and solar projects. CERC also observed that the NTPC is a Maharatna Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE). It is implicit that NTPC has a very strong balance sheet and has the trust of shareholders. The creditworthiness of NTPC has also been recognized by various credit rating agencies. As a result, CERC is of the view that even though NTPC does not meet the current ratio and liquidity ratio criteria, it is financially sound with regard to liquidity for carrying out electricity trade. NTPC meets other criteria for grant of trading license as required under the \u2018Trading License Regulations.\u2019 Keeping in view the policy of the Government of India for promoting renewable energy, the CERC relaxed the current ratio and liquidity ratio requirement in public interest and proposes to grant Category-I trading license to NTPC and has directed to invite further suggestions or objections to this proposal of the Commission. According to Mercom\u2019s India Solar PV Project Tracker, NTPC has 873 MW of solar PV projects under operation and 268 MW of solar PV project under various stages of development. Recently, CERC issued draft regulations for Power System Development Fund to enable fast-paced development of transmission infrastructure in the country.

        "premise": "HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group has agreed to sell its two Australian projects to a China-backed developer for a total of A$1.13 billion ($913 million) in equity and assumed debt. Wanda Group will get A$315 million for the sale, and the buyer will also repay A$815.1 million in assumed debt on behalf of the company, according to a statement by Wanda Hotel Development Co Ltd (0169.HK), the Hong Kong-listed unit of Wanda Group, on Monday. The deal, signed on Jan. 18, comes just days after Wanda sold a high-profile London luxury development project for around $81 million, the latest in a string of asset sales that underscore financial strains hitting the Chinese conglomerate. Wanda Group will cash in HK$10.32 billion ($1.3 bln) and make a total gain of HK$1.28 billion after the disposal of London, Sydney and Gold Coast developments. The buyer is AWH Investment Group Pty Ltd, the statement said, an associate of China-backed Australian property and investment group Yuhu Group. Yuhu, in an emailed statement to Reuters confirming the purchase, said the projects would create over 1,500 jobs in Australia. \u201cConsistent with the company\u2019s strategy to deleverage, the company considers that the disposal represents an opportunity for the group to realize its investment in both Gold Coast Project and Sydney Project and would benefit the group by strengthening the liquidity and financial position of the group,\u201d Wanda Hotel said. Wanda Hotel said the disposal of the company, which owns the One Circular Quay in Sydney and 55 percent of the Jewel Resort on the Gold Coast which are both under development, would result in a gain of around HK$556 million for Wanda Group. Wanda Hotel owns 60 percent of the company, while Wanda HK owns 40 percent. Both are subsidiaries of Wanda Group. Wanda Hotel will also use around HK$4.1 billion of the proceeds to repay loans and interest due to Wanda HK, it added. Shares of Wanda Hotel will resume trading on Tuesday. They have been suspended since Jan. 19. The sales are expected to lessen financial strains on Dalian Wanda Group, caused by a major acquisition spree, by helping Wanda HK to meet upcoming debt deadlines. China\u2019s regulators last year told banks to stop providing funding for several of Wanda\u2019s overseas acquisitions, sources have said, part of a crackdown on what Beijing sees as irrational spending by some domestic conglomerates. Since then, Wanda, whose businesses range from real estate to football and cinemas, has embarked on a string of asset sales.

        "premise": "FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc. The U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor. Coming under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. However, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter. \"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt. The plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial center - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\" An ECB spokesman declined to comment. Goldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities. But banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit. Currently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel. A bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion). Goldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank. Goldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said. The bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote. Bankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March. Securing the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy. Goldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services. The bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market. Goldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Even were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators.

        "premise": "Facebook is trying to close the augmented reality gap with Snapchat with the help of an army of third-party developers. Today, eight months after debuting its Augmented Reality Camera Effects platform and AR Studio tool at F8, Facebook is allowing all developers to start building AR experiences for its Facebook Camera. That includes \u201cWorld Effects\u201d \u2014 Facebook\u2019s copy of Snapchat\u2019s World Lenses \u2014 that augment your environment with 3D objects rather than just your selfies. AR Studio becomes available to all developers today, and World Effects will open up there in the next few days for use on Facebook and Messenger. For example, on Messenger you\u2019ll be able to add a 3D heart floating above someone\u2019s head, add an arrow to point to something in a panorama or add a celebrating robot that plays music to jazz up a drab video. Facebook\u2019s new World Effects \u201cWe want artists, developers, brands and more creators to be able to build and share amazing AR experiences,\u201d writes Facebook director Ficus Kirkpatrick. \u201cBy opening AR Studio to all creators, we\u2019re taking steps towards making AR more a part of everyday life.\u201d Facebook\u2019s opportunity here is to take advantage of Snapchat\u2019s anti-developer attitude. Snapchat has yet to fully embrace third-party AR content beyond some basic image frame submissions and work with a few fine artists like Jeff Koons. Meanwhile, Facebook has been operating a developer platform for more than a decade, and has fostered a huge community of coders looking to get their content in front of Facebook\u2019s massive 2 billion user audience. Since launching the Camera Effects platform, Facebook has worked with more than 2,000 brands, publishers and artists to make AR experiences. This could lay the groundwork for Sponsored World Effects, which might let businesses pay to offer branded AR toys inside of Facebook. Facebook\u2019s AR Studio makes it easy to tie animations and imagery to certain cues like someone raising their eyebrows \u201cWe\u2019ve been continuously advancing the capabilities of the platform, with improved face tracking, new graphics capabilities, better scripting, and now world effects. This is only the beginning, and we can\u2019t wait to see how creators bring art to life through AR Studio.\u201d Users can open the Facebook or Messenger Camera, scroll through the World Effects and tap to add one to what they\u2019re seeing. Some other launch experiences include a unicorn you can play with, or the ability to add floating 3D word bubbles like \u201clove,\u201d \u201cbae,\u201d \u201cheart\u201d and \u201cmiss you.\u201d Facebook has encountered some stumbling blocks in its quest for AR. Facebook Stories, where Camera Effects content is typically shared, hasn\u2019t taken off the way Instagram Stories has. Now it\u2019s resorted to allowing users to cross-post to Facebook Stories from Instagram or Messenger, but they still don\u2019t get many views. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s ARKit and Google\u2019s ARCore give developers an alternative way to build AR into their own apps at the operating system level rather than having to piggyback on Facebook. Essentially, Facebook\u2019s best lure to developers is its inherent reach thanks to a massive baked-in audience. But if Facebook Stories aren\u2019t popular to watch, that audience isn\u2019t easily accessible. Its best bet might be opening the Camera Effects platform and World Lenses to Instagram where tons of people watch Stories. The real world is too vast for a single company to spice up with augmented reality. But by crowdsourcing development, Facebook could eventually offer AR experiences connected to any location, real-world object, holiday or activity. That breadth of offering will be key to becoming the default way people explore the AR world. Whichever app offers the most and best experiences will be the one people wave in the air to see what\u2019s hidden out of view.",

        "premise": "A funny thing happened to Vine, Twitter\u2019s short-form video app, after its initial buzz wore off: It kept going. If you haven\u2019t checked lately, Vine, launched in early 2013, is still a thing. It has evolved from a social \u201cInstagram-for-video\u201d built atop Twitter into a unique mobile entertainment platform with its own style, format, and celebrities. And as mobile video continues its long-awaited rise, Vine has built and maintained an impressive audience. Vine serves more than 100 million people across the web every month, according to the company, delivering more than 1.5 billion \u201cloops\u201d\u2014its term for video views\u2014per day. It is a top-100 free iPhone app in 13 countries, according to App Annie, a service that tracks app stores, and is currently ahead of Tinder and Shazam in the US rankings. Meanwhile, comScore says Vine reached 34.5 million unique visitors in the US in June across desktop and mobile\u2014roughly the same as Snapchat, which has grown rapidly over the past year and is valued by investors at $16 billion. Vine owes some of its success to the fact that it is a simple, free video-hosting service that works well with Twitter. Sports and television clips, for example, are hardly special to the app. Just as on YouTube, many are uploaded without permission. But various teams and leagues, including Major League Baseball, are also using Vine to quickly post highlights. And Vine fits a broader trend. Like Snapchat\u2019s short videos, Vines seem exactly the sort of mobile-native content \u201csnack\u201d that people would watch on a smartphone, or even a smaller-screened device, like an Apple Watch. (Apple used a simple Vine app in a recent Apple Watch keynote demo.) But what\u2019s most interesting is the homegrown group of \u201cViners\u201d that has developed. These mostly young creative-types produce an enviable stream of short videos, ranging from the artistic and musical to one-liner, sketch-comedy-like micro-skits. The top personalities are wildly popular, tend to collaborate with and reference each other often, and have come to define a big part of the service. These include Lele Pons (above), the only Viner with more than 6 billion cumulative loops; KingBach, whose Vine-native slapstick often satirizes relationships and money; and Logan Paul, whose recent profile on Tech Insider starts with a shirtless photo in his Los Angeles apartment, standing next to a boom mic. \u201cI want to be the biggest entertainer in the world,\u201d Paul told the reporter. Like early YouTube stars, you wouldn\u2019t have known their names before. But each typically generates millions of views and thousands of comments when they post. While Vine doesn\u2019t directly generate any revenue\u2014and has no current plans to\u2014it has become a playground for these creators, who sell their popularity to brands in the form of sponsored Vines. Twitter, to its credit, has considered this. Many of these deals are now brokered by a talent agency of sorts called Niche, which Twitter acquired earlier this year. Another cool thing: Any random Vine can go viral, aided by Vine\u2019s recirculation features and, likely, its connection to Twitter. After one teen user, Kayla \u201cPeaches Monroee\u201d Newman, posted a video last June noting that her eyebrows were \u201con fleek,\u201d the phrase spread rapidly on Twitter and throughout society, referenced by IHOP, Taco Bell, and Kim Kardashian. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about shouting into a dark hole,\u201d Jason Mante, Vine\u2019s head of user experience, tells Quartz. \u201cPeople are putting themselves on Vine\u2014and putting content and ideas and stories onto Vine\u2014knowing that there\u2019s so much potential for millions of people to see this thing.\u201d Yet Vine, which has about 40 staffers, isn\u2019t often mentioned when parent-company Twitter describes its plans\u2014a topic of increasingly frequent discussion. Twitter, whose stock price has declined almost 50% since April, now finds itself in an unenviable position. It must re-accelerate audience growth and rethink its product for a broader market, while also undergoing an awkward, public CEO transition. On its most recent earnings call, where co-founder and interim CEO Jack Dorsey began to lay out Twitter\u2019s strategy, Vine was only mentioned in passing. More attention seems to be going to Periscope, a live-video-streaming startup that Twitter acquired and launched earlier this year. And this makes sense. As Twitter tries to promote itself as a platform for global discussion around live events, the real-time nature of Periscope seems a closer fit than Vine, where the most popular videos tend to involve planning, props, and editing. To its credit, Twitter hasn\u2019t ruined Vine\u2014which runs as a separate company within Twitter\u2019s New York offices\u2014the way many big companies botch acquisitions. A Twitter rep, asked by Quartz whether the company plans to continue to invest in and support Vine, said, \u201cWe do!\u201d And Vine has a dozen different job openings listed, from iOS engineer and \u201cmusic content strategist\u201d to head of product. So why don\u2019t you hear more about Vine? One reason, perhaps, is that you\u2019re reading highbrow, global business news publications instead of lad mags. But Vine is also in a somewhat strange position: It is a small, comfortably financed startup within a large organization. It doesn\u2019t have a mercurial, fameballing founder at the helm. (Its co-founder and former general manager Dom Hoffman left a long time ago.) Nor is it in the business of gloating about its stats to raise venture capital at increasingly high valuations. While some of that pressure can be helpful (and fun) to keep growth top-of-mind, this setup gives Vine an opportunity to focus on building tools and audience for its community of creators and fans\u2014assuming they don\u2019t bail for the next flashy new thing.",

The facility occupies a 2,100-square-foot (195-square-metre) storefront space in the coastal Californian city. Designed with both adults and kids in mind, it is intended to foster \"productivity, creativity and community\". It features a high ceiling with a series of wood-bow trusses, which Zooco Estudio used as an organisational device. Three separate areas were established \u2013 a cafe-cum-shop, a kids' play area and a work zone. The trusses also informed the design of plywood partitions and certain pieces of decor. \"Using the original truss ceiling as an example of a universal geometric language, we created a repetitive modular and constructive system that reminds us of a puzzle,\" said Zooco Estudio in a project description. \"This adaptable system creates appealing elevations in all the three areas.\" The front zone contains a coffee bar and a boutique with kid-themed merchandise. Visitors can sit at round wooden tables and pastel-hued chairs. Hanging on the walls are triangular and semi-circular iron racks. The front area also features tile-clad blocks that are used to form shelving and a display counter. \"The modular and movable cubes are made out of 10-by-10 ceramic tiles in pink and blue, which is the brand's colour palette,\" the team said. \"This offers the flexibility to configure the space according to different needs.\" Situated behind the cafe and shop is the children's area, called Tinyland, which aims to offer \"purposefully selected sustainable toys to stimulate imaginative play\". A playground consists of wooden structures such as a ball pit, a slide and a small stage. The room also has a studio space where kids can work on art projects and take classes. Concrete flooring is covered with an eco-foam material. The rear zone houses the co-working area for adults.

        "premise": "Fearing for their lives , hundreds of African immigrants have begun arriving in their home countries after fleeing the bloody violence that has swept across South Africa . Among them were some 400 Zimbabweans \u2013 including pregnant women and babies \u2013 who were packed onto buses to escape the anti-immigrant attacks that have left seven people dead in recent days . They were pictured wearily disembarking in the safe haven of a migration centre in the Zimbabwean border town of Beitbridge after leaving Durban yesterday . About 3,200 Malawians have also sought refuge in temporary camps amid the ensuing chaos . Their plight emerged as South Africa 's influential Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini denied whipping up the xenophobic hatred in the country that has forced thousands from their homes . Scroll down for video . Safe haven : Zimbabwe victims of xenophobic attacks in South Africa disembark from a bus on arrival at the International Organisation for Migration Reception and Support Centre in Beitbridge , Zimbabwe . Shock : A pregnant woman stands in a registration queue awaiting her turn at the International Organisation for Migration Reception and Support Centre in Beitbridge , after fleeing attacks that have seven people dead . Two Zimbabwean Nationals sleep inside a tent at the International Organisation for Migration Reception and Support Centre grounds after being repatriated following xenophobic attacks in South Africa . Stunned : Venge Mundai , a survivor of the xenophobic violence is looked after by a doctor inside a makeshift clinic at the International Organisation for Migration Reception and Support Centre in Beitbridge . Zwelithini had made an angry speech last month blaming immigrants for rising crime and saying they must leave the country , in an outburst seen as inciting the spate of attacks . But addressing a tribal gathering of several thousand Zulus in the port city of Durban the king insisted he had been taken out of context . 'My speech ... was directed at the police , calling for stricter law enforcement , but that was never reported , ' he said . 'The public was instead given another side of my speech , which has been twisted and misrepresented . This violence directed at our brothers and sisters is shameful . ' Meanwhile , in Malawi , Information Minister Kondwani Nankhumwa said six buses carrying 390 Malawians from Durban were sent to Malawi yesterday , while five more buses were expected to leave today . Those killed in the anti-immigrant unrest included two Malawians , according to Malawi 's government . Louis Lulu Mnguni , South Africa 's top diplomat in Nigeria , said his Lagos mission has warned South African citizens in Nigeria 'to exercise vigilance and limit their movements ' following threats of reprisal attacks . Malawian families fleeing xenophobic violence disembark a bus at Kamudzu stadium in Blantyre , after being repatriated from South Africa . A group of 390 Malawians fleeing xenophobic violence wait at Kamudzu stadium in Blantyre . South African authorities have struggled to contain mobs in the economic capital Johannesburg and Durban who have been attacking foreigners from Zimbabwe , Malawi , Mozambique and other African countries . Similarly , security was increased at the South African High Commission in Accra , Ghana , after telephoned threats , said Lulama Xingwana , the high commissioner . Activists in some African countries have also organised protests and called for a boycott of South African goods as South Africa is a powerful trading partner in the region . Kenmare Resources , a Dublin-based company , said it temporarily repatriated its 62 South African workers at a titanium mine in Mozambique after 'reciprocal unrest ' there that stemmed from the South African violence . The mine 's total workforce is nearly 1,400 . The outbreak of violence in South Africa against immigrants has tarnished the reputation of a country that has one of the biggest economies on the continent and has been a destination for people seeking opportunity and an escape from turbulence elsewhere in Africa . Horrific pictures released yesterday showed a Mozambican man bleeding to death in a gutter after being savagely attack by a gang who stabbed him with knives and bludgeoned him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg . In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself . South Africa was also dubbed the 'rainbow nation ' for its relatively peaceful transition to democracy after the end of white racist rule in 1994 . Attack : Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg . Now the government is struggling to contain negative fallout from attacks on immigrants in some areas of Durban and Johannesburg that killed seven people since the end of March . Professor Chris Landsberg , an African diplomacy and foreign policy expert at the University of Johannesburg said the South African government should be 'less reactive and more proactive ' in dealing with tensions over immigrants . He said the country should 'be a bit more humble ' about its aspirations as a continental leader , adding : 'We are in denial . ' Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini , an influential figure among the Zulu ethnic group in South Africa , condemned the attacks in a speech Monday at a Durban sports stadium . His remarks followed allegations that he provoked the violence with reported comments in which he said foreigners should go home . Doctors tried in vain to save Mr Sithole 's life . His cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket . President Jacob Zuma postponed a ceremony , scheduled for next week , in which the country 's highest official honor is bestowed on South Africans and foreigners who have contributed to South Africa , his office said . The event will be postponed so South Africa can mourn the victims of the anti-immigrant violence , including three South Africans and four foreigners , it said . The attacks in South Africa stem from a perception that immigrants , many from other African countries , are taking jobs at the expense of South Africans in a country with high unemployment . Many people have entered South Africa illegally , though the government has said a large number of immigrants are working legally and contributing to economic development . The violence recalls similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which 60 people died . In January this year , four people died during looting of foreign-owned shops in areas of Johannesburg . The violence is particularly unfortunate because other African nations provided shelter and other aid to South African activists during the battle against white minority rule , said Xingwana , the South African diplomat in Ghana . 'The young people have forgotten the contribution of African countries to South Africa 's fight against apartheid and need to be educated on this , ' she said .",

        "premise": "Uber, the world\u2019s most valuable startup, just made a major gaffe: The ride-hailing company accidentally released the personal information of hundreds of its drivers, allegedly leaking social security numbers, scans of drivers\u2019 licenses, taxi certification forms, and other private data. According to Motherboard, the leak was first reported by drivers on Tuesday, and was associated with the release of Uber\u2019s new Partner app for drivers. \u201cWe were notified about a bug impacting a fraction of our U.S. drivers earlier this afternoon,\u201d an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to Motherboard. \u201cWithin 30 minutes our security team had fixed the issue.\u201d Uber says the breach impacted 674 drivers in the U.S., and that less than a thousand documents were compromised. The leaked data was only shown to drivers who were logged into their accounts on the Partner app, Uber claims. One driver told Motherboard that he detected the problem while uploading a document to the app; he refreshed the page and was shown hundreds of documents from fellow Uber drivers. \u201cWhen I looked closer, it might have been the database of Uber drivers that are taxicab drivers that have access to Uber,\u201d he told Motherboard. \u201cThere were a lot of taxi certification forms and livery drivers licenses and W-9 forms with Social Security numbers for taxi cab companies.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence, at the moment, that Uber\u2019s data landed in the wrong hands, or that any of the drivers have misused the information they had access to. But Uber drivers have reason to be concerned: The company hasn\u2019t demonstrated that user privacy is top of mind, according to Motherboard. Last week, Uber patched up a major security flaw that gave hackers continued access to user accounts even after passwords had been changed. And earlier this year, Uber users had complained for months that they were getting charged for trips they didn\u2019t make. In March, Motherboard had reported that a number of Uber user accounts were being sold on the Internet, using stolen login information. With the rampant data breaches that now plague companies and even government entities, it\u2019s imperative that a tech giant like Uber address security concerns effectively\u2013without unintentionally leaking its own data and contributing to the problem. On Wednesday, Uber announced a partnership with e-commerce platform Shopify, to offer same-day delivery for vendors in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. The company\u2019s courier service, UberRush, first launched last year exclusively in New York. [via BBC]",

The symptoms vary depending on where a child 's tumour is . The first signs can be vague , and include tiredness , a loss of appetite and pain in the bones . If the tumour is in a child 's tummy , it may be swollen and the child may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine . Where a tumour is growing in a child 's chest , they may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing . Tumours growing in the neck can be visible as a lump , and a child is likely to complain of breathing and swallowing problems .

        "premise": "TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO), Canada\u2019s third biggest lender, is in discussions to sell a C$1 billion ($715 million) vendor and equipment financing portfolio, according to four sources familiar with the matter. Flags on the office building of Scotiabank are seen in the commercial district of San Isidro in Lima, April 11, 2015. REUTERS/Enrique Castro-Mendivil Scotiabank, which began the sale process a few weeks ago, is in talks with several parties including Toronto-based Element Financial (EFN.TO), said three of the sources. Two of the sources said the assets that Scotia is looking to sell are housed within its Roynat unit, which the bank acquired about 20 years ago. Roynat provides funding between C$250,000 and C$50 million to small and medium-sized businesses. It mainly offers financing options like term loans, asset based lending and leasing to more than 1,000 companies across Canada. All four sources, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to publicly discuss the matter, said that discussions are ongoing and there is no guarantee a deal will be reached. Scotia\u2019s sale, coupled with commercial lender CIT Group\u2019s (CIT.N) recently outlined plans to sell its similar Canadian business, have given Element some reason to weigh up the planned sale of its own Canadian commercial and vendor (C&V) financing operations, said three of the sources. Scotiabank declined to comment on the matter. A spokesman for Element said the firm\u2019s strategic review around its Canadian C&V business remains ongoing. The company separately issued a statement late on Wednesday stating that growing its fleet management business remains its top priority. Last year, Element became the North American leader in the fleet management business when it acquired General Electric Co\u2019s (GE.N) fleet arm in the United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand for $6.9 billion. \u201cAny opportunities to improve the marketability and value of our Canadian Commercial & Vendor Finance business through non-material bolt-on acquisitions would only be considered if those transactions immediately enhance the fundamental economics of that business,\u201d Element\u2019s Chief Executive Steve Hudson said in the statement. Element, Scotia and CIT all compete against one another in the C&V market in Canada, servicing and financing mainly small and medium-sized businesses. Element said in October it would reinvest proceeds from the sale of its C&V unit, which has a C$1 billion asset portfolio, into acquisitions in its core fleet management arm. Three of the sources said that Element sees an opportunity to expand its own C&V base with the Scotia assets, boosting its own unit\u2019s profitability by gaining economies of scale. Such a move would give Element the option to, at a later point, sell a larger and more profitable C&V portfolio. The three said that while a final decision has not yet been made, Element may not push ahead with a sale of its C&V assets in the near-term, adding that a final decision is likely to be made later this month. Two of the sources said Element is also interested in CIT\u2019s Canadian assets that include about $800 million of loans and equipment finance assets, which the New York-based company put on the auction block in October. CIT declined to comment on the talks around the sale of its Canadian assets. In a research note to clients following the Reuters report, RBC analyst Geoffrey Kwan said acquiring Scotia\u2019s and CIT\u2019s portfolios could materially help improve profitability in Element\u2019s C&V business. \u201cIn our view, consolidating the Canadian commercial & vendor finance industry could make sense for Element Financial, but it would still leave them operating in four different business verticals, which contrasts to prior suggestions of evolving into a more focused fleet and rail leasing company,\u201d Kwan said.

            "TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO), Canada\u2019s third biggest lender, is in discussions to sell a C$1 billion ($715 million) vendor and equipment financing portfolio, according to four sources familiar with the matter.",
            "Flags on the office building of Scotiabank are seen in the commercial district of San Isidro in Lima, April 11, 2015.",
            "REUTERS/Enrique Castro-Mendivil Scotiabank, which began the sale process a few weeks ago, is in talks with several parties including Toronto-based Element Financial (EFN.TO), said three of the sources.",
            "Two of the sources said the assets that Scotia is looking to sell are housed within its Roynat unit, which the bank acquired about 20 years ago.",
            "Roynat provides funding between C$250,000 and C$50 million to small and medium-sized businesses.",
            "It mainly offers financing options like term loans, asset based lending and leasing to more than 1,000 companies across Canada.",
            "All four sources, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to publicly discuss the matter, said that discussions are ongoing and there is no guarantee a deal will be reached.",
            "Scotia\u2019s sale, coupled with commercial lender CIT Group\u2019s (CIT.N) recently outlined plans to sell its similar Canadian business, have given Element some reason to weigh up the planned sale of its own Canadian commercial and vendor (C&V) financing operations, said three of the sources.",
            "Scotiabank declined to comment on the matter.",
            "A spokesman for Element said the firm\u2019s strategic review around its Canadian C&V business remains ongoing.",
            "The company separately issued a statement late on Wednesday stating that growing its fleet management business remains its top priority.",
            "Last year, Element became the North American leader in the fleet management business when it acquired General Electric Co\u2019s (GE.N) fleet arm in the United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand for $6.9 billion.",
            "\u201cAny opportunities to improve the marketability and value of our Canadian Commercial & Vendor Finance business through non-material bolt-on acquisitions would only be considered if those transactions immediately enhance the fundamental economics of that business,\u201d Element\u2019s Chief Executive Steve Hudson said in the statement.",
            "Element, Scotia and CIT all compete against one another in the C&V market in Canada, servicing and financing mainly small and medium-sized businesses.",
            "Element said in October it would reinvest proceeds from the sale of its C&V unit, which has a C$1 billion asset portfolio, into acquisitions in its core fleet management arm.",
            "Three of the sources said that Element sees an opportunity to expand its own C&V base with the Scotia assets, boosting its own unit\u2019s profitability by gaining economies of scale.",
            "Such a move would give Element the option to, at a later point, sell a larger and more profitable C&V portfolio.",
            "The three said that while a final decision has not yet been made, Element may not push ahead with a sale of its C&V assets in the near-term, adding that a final decision is likely to be made later this month.",
            "Two of the sources said Element is also interested in CIT\u2019s Canadian assets that include about $800 million of loans and equipment finance assets, which the New York-based company put on the auction block in October.",
            "CIT declined to comment on the talks around the sale of its Canadian assets.",
            "In a research note to clients following the Reuters report, RBC analyst Geoffrey Kwan said acquiring Scotia\u2019s and CIT\u2019s portfolios could materially help improve profitability in Element\u2019s C&V business.",
            "\u201cIn our view, consolidating the Canadian commercial & vendor finance industry could make sense for Element Financial, but it would still leave them operating in four different business verticals, which contrasts to prior suggestions of evolving into a more focused fleet and rail leasing company,\u201d Kwan said.",

        "premise": "Gallup, the venerable news and public opinion company, recently released a survey of just fewer than 500 K-12 teachers in the U.S. in which they asked about students\u2019 use of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers. The headline of the Gallup survey results was, \u201cU.S. Teachers See Digital Devices as Net Plus for Education.\u201d For those in the education technology (edtech) community, that\u2019s great news because it confirms the premise that tech-enabled teaching and learning is making headway. Or at least it implies that teachers see the devices as potentially important tools in their classrooms. The problem is, that\u2019s not exactly what the survey found. In almost direct contrast to the Gallup headline, the results show that most teachers \u2013 58% \u2013 said digital devices were not helpful in education. Of the teachers responding to Gallup, 30% said the devices were basically irrelevant, neither a help nor a harm to education, and 28% said the devices were \u201cmostly harmful\u201d to education. The remaining 41% of teachers did report that digital devices were \u201cmostly helpful,\u201d but that\u2019s still a sizable chunk less than those who thought the devices were, at best, not that. The low percentage of teachers who said digital devices were helpful was arresting enough that Brandon Busteed, Executive Director, Education & Workforce Development at Gallup and co-author of the survey findings, commented on his LinkedIn page, \u201c\u2026I was surprised to see that it's just 41% who say they have a helpful effect on their education.\u201d Busteed is probably not alone. Those results should be equally surprising and alarming to those who\u2019ve invested in an edtech revolution reinventing our schools. That, after more than a decade of development and marketing and after billions of dollars in spending, a solid majority of teachers find digital devices to be of no consequence or outright harmful to teaching may signal a serious problem for edtech. The Gallup teacher survey has other warning signs for the edtech community too. Teachers in higher grades (9-12), where teaching and learning tends to be more structured and more complex, were even more skeptical of the educational value of digital devices \u2013 64% said they were either not impactful or actually harmful to education. There was a sliver of silver lining in the Gallup results in that a slight majority (51%) of teachers under 4o years old said digital devices were \u201cmostly helpful\u201d in education. But even that finding hid a cloud. Even with 51% in the \u201chelpful\u201d camp, 47% of those younger teachers still said digital devices were either harmful or of no impact. A roughly even split of 51/47 among younger, presumably more tech savvy teachers, cannot be encouraging. Putting aside Gallup\u2019s curious tech-affirming headline, it\u2019s clear that the report authors know this finding is not good news for edtech. A portion of the report\u2019s conclusion reads, \u201cThe implications of these findings for schools and educational technology providers are potentially significant. Without strong support from teachers regarding the value of digital devices in the classroom, the promise of technology in education won't be fully realized.\u201d That\u2019s precisely right. If teachers are not convinced to be enthusiastic cheerleaders for learning technology, an edtech future is probably much further away than many believe. And based on Gallup\u2019s findings, teachers are neither cheering nor leading a future of teaching with digital devices. In fact, the challenge is deeper than just whether digital devices are helpful teaching tools or not. The same Gallup teacher survey reported that 69% of teachers thought digital devices were \u201cmostly harmful\u201d to \u201cstudents' mental health.\u201d Only 4% of teachers thought they were \u201cmostly helpful.\u201d It\u2019s going to be a steep climb for even the most passionate edtech evangelist to convince teachers to embrace something they \u2013 by a 69 to 4 margin \u2013 see as harmful to their students. It\u2019s possible to read the results, as Gallup did, as a teacher issue. Their report said, \u201cIf these powerful resources are to be integrated in a productive way into students' education, schools must take appropriate action -- including professional development programs for teachers on using digital devices in classrooms.\u201d It\u2019s also possible to read the results inversely and listen to teachers when they say there may be some real issues with digital devices as education tools. And since teachers are both important end-user customers for edtech products and subject experts on teaching and learning, it may be unwise to assume the disconnect is on the teacher side of the relationship. If your customers are not buying, it just may say something about what you\u2019re selling.",

        "premise": "In January 2013 we posted a report titled \"Apple Thinks outside the Box with Cash Dispensing Network.\" That particular invention was designed to be a part of \"Wallet\"(previously Passbook). The Wallet app invention at that time was shown to offer a series of future services including a number of sub categories for credit, debit and a new one related to their newly proposed ad-hoc cash dispensing network using iTunes and Maps. Apple stated that there were times when users just needed cash and without an ATM in sight their new network would be able to bring a cash requester together with a cash provider using a new App that made the processes somewhat painless. Today, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals a possible new method to allow two iPhone users with Touch ID to make a private sales transaction. This could be handy for small businesses and even those holding a neighborhood garage sale and beyond. Apple's Patent Background There is presently increasing interest in using electronic devices to conduct financial transactions. However, it can be difficult for individuals to directly conduct financial transactions with each other using their electronic devices. For example, credit-card transactions are typically processed by a payment network, and it can be complicated and time-consuming for individuals to interact with a payment network to conduct a financial transaction with each other. In addition, credit-card providers usually charge higher fees for financial transactions where there is no proof that a physical credit card was present. If two individuals attempt to directly conduct a financial transaction, they may face higher fees, which may discourage them from using their electronic devices to conduct the financial transaction. Apple Invents Person-to-Person Payment System Apple's invention generally relates to wireless communications, wireless electronic devices, and more specifically to techniques for conducting financial transactions by communicating encrypted financial credentials between the wireless electronic devices. Using electronic devices (such as cellular telephones) that communicate wirelessly, two individuals can make person-to-person payments. In particular, an individual using an electronic device may identify another proximate electronic device of a counterparty in a financial transaction, and may provide an encrypted payment packet to the other electronic device that includes: a financial credential for a financial account of the individual, a payment amount, and a payment sign. When the other electronic device receives the encrypted payment applet, the counterparty may accept the payment in the financial transaction specified by the encrypted payment packet. Then, the other electronic device may provide the encrypted payment packet and another encrypted payment packet (with a financial credential for a financial account of the counterparty, the payment amount and the opposite payment sign) to a third party that completes the financial transaction. Subsequently, the electronic device and the other electronic device may receive a notification from the third party that the financial transaction is complete. Apple notes in patent FIG. 7 that a user interface, associated with the passbook (now Wallet) may be used to identify proximate electronic devices and/or to specify details of the financial transaction (such as the payment amount and the payment sign). In particular, the user interface #700 may display electronic devices that are proximate to the user's electronic device (for example, the proximate electronic devices may be identified via wireless communication). The user may select one of the displayed electronic devices by touching an icon that represents an electronic device. Next, the user may enter a payment amount (and payment sign) into a displayed window in the user interface. If the user has not already activated or selected a payment applet, the user interface may then display available payment applets (which are proxies for financial vehicles, such as credit cards, associated with the financial accounts), and may receive the user's selection. In addition, if the selected payment applet requires authentication, and the user has not already been authenticated, the user interface may display a prompt to the user to provide authentication information (such as 'please touch the fingerprint sensor'). This prompt may be displayed until the user has been successfully authenticated. Furthermore, the user interface may intuitively indicate that the financial transaction is pending (using an hourglass or by modulating the intensity of the selected displayed electronic device). Once the financial transaction is complete, the user interface may eliminate these intuitive sensory clues and/or may display a window that indicates that the financial transaction was completed. In Apple's patent FIG. 8 noted above we're able to see a flow diagram illustrating a method for providing prepaid credit to a financial vehicle associated with one of the electronic devices Patent Credits Apple credits Senior Director of Apple Pay Engineering Timothy Hurley who came to Apple from Citibank, as one of the inventors of this invention along with Apple Pay engineer Ahmer Khan.

        "premise": "Uber has launched Uber Express POOL officially after a lengthy trial period that kicked off in San Francisco last November, and has until now remained available only in that market. Starting today, it\u2019s coming to DC, LA, Miami, Philadelphia, San Diego and Denver, and more cities will be added over the next few weeks and months across the U.S. The Express POOL launch brings a change to the current Uber POOL model that\u2019s designed to make for more direct routing, with easier pickups for drivers and fewer annoying deviations from the route for riders thanks to two key actions Uber is asking riders to help out with: Walking and waiting. Basically, when riders hail an Uber Express POOL, they\u2019ll be asked to wait a few minutes prior to the trip\u2019s start, and/or walk to a nearby pick up spot, or from a nearby drop off point, in order to help optimize the route in as straight a line as possible along a path that can work for a number of different riders. The Express POOL option will live right alongside the standard, existing POOL option that\u2019s there right now in the app, at least for the foreseeable future, and riders can have the choice. But ultimately, Uber thinks that many riders will prefer opting to walk a bit and wait a bit, since the goal is to ultimately save everyone involved time and frustration. [gallery ids=\"1600521,1600520,1600519,1600518,1600517,1600516\"] Some of the big challenges around making POOL work as designed to provide the lowest cost option of Uber\u2019s various tiers to the most people possible have been around intelligent routing. The challenge of handling predictions of when and where people will be, along with building routes that not only work from an efficiency perspective, but also from the perspective of serving real humans in a way that doesn\u2019t leave them frustrated or confused, proved to be a massive one. Uber\u2019s intent with POOL is to help lower the cost of entry to its product to make it the massive base of the ride hailing pyramid that can reach the most people thanks to affordability near on par with public transit. While it accounts for around 20 percent of rides in markets where it\u2019s available, based on a rough average, that\u2019s still not obviously the majority, and so it\u2019s hoping that tweaks to the product that provide a better overall experience will help increase its general appeal.",

        "premise": "(Reuters) - A furore over alleged anti-semitism in Britain\u2019s main opposition party widened on Monday when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn exchanged accusations on Twitter over Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's Labour Party, visits Harper Adams University in Newport, August 14, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Staples Labour has been wrestling accusations of anti-semitism for months, and Corbyn has previously apologised for what he has described as \u201cpockets\u201d of anti-semitism in the organisation. Britain\u2019s right-leaning Daily Mail on Friday reported that Corbyn, on a visit to Tunisia in 2014, had laid a wreath at the graves of members of a Palestinian group that killed 11 Israeli athletes and a German policeman at the 1972 Munich Olympics. It said the cemetery houses a memorial to the dozens killed in the 1985 Israeli bombing of the Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters in exile in Tunis, as well as the graves of members of Black September, a PLO splinter group that carried out the Munich attack. It published a photograph it said showed Corbyn standing near the graves of Black September members. Labour said Corbyn, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, was in Tunis to honour the victims of the 1985 raid. Unimpressed, Netanyahu said in a tweet: \u201cThe laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorists who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone \u2013 left, right and everything in between.\u201d Corbyn responded: \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s claims about my actions and words are false. What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.\u201d The Labour Party said Corbyn did not lay a wreath at the graves of anyone linked to Black September and he condemned the Munich attack. Corbyn however told reporters on Monday: \u201cI was present when (a wreath) was laid, I don\u2019t think I was involved in it,\u201d adding that the visit was a peace-seeking exercise. Despite deep divisions in the Conservative government as it negotiates Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, Labour\u2019s poll standing appears to have been damaged by the anti-semitism row. A YouGov poll last week showed that 39 percent of those asked would vote for the Conservatives, a gain of one point for May\u2019s party compared to last week when the two biggest parties were level. Labour dropped three points to 35 percent. Writing and reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary in Edinburgh; Editing by William Maclean",

The nationwide strike follows action by French air traffic controllers which involved a two-day walkout starting yesterday . Now workers at the most visited paid monument in the world have joined the walkout in a solidarity with the thousands taking to the streets across the country in union-led protests against public spending cuts . Signs were placed at the foot of the Eiffel Tower warning that the landmark was closed due to strike action . There are an average 25,000 ascents at the tower every day , and at \u20ac15.50 ( \u00a311.25 ) a ticket , the closure will cost Paris tourism almost \u20ac387,500 ( \u00a3280,000 ) in entry fees , excluding gifts bought and food and drink sales . Speaking to The Local , union representative Stephane Dieu said that '90 per cent ' of staff had voted to strike and that signs had been placed at the foot of the tower to ensure 'tourists do n't hang around for nothing . ' The marches nationwide with a main rally in Paris are a test of how much support unions can muster over spending curbs which they claim undermine public service and purchasing power to the detriment of the euro zone 's second-largest economy . Charles de Gaulle Airport , pictured , and other French hubs are being affected by strike action . Local media said staff who man Paris 's Eiffel Tower would keep it shut it until 6pm local time as part of the strike . Representative of CGT union , one of the unions who voted to strike , St\u00e9phane God , told AFP that the Tower is expected to be shut for 18 hours in total . Unions said they expected tens of thousands of marchers to join the main rally in Paris by the end of the day . The strike by air controllers has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe . The walk-out is one of a series planned this month , with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2 . Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps . The Eiffel Tower is due to reopen to the public at around 6pm this evening . Local reports claim turnout across the country is mixed , with just 1,000 taking to the streets in Strabourg , while Toulouse reported 8,000 attending demonstrations . 'We are here ... to get a change of direction from this government which claims it is left-wing , ' said CGT official Pierre Tommasi of a march which included hospital , research and transport sector staff .

Owning a private jet is a luxury only afford to the wealthy , and you 'll need to be to continually fork out for landing charges which can reach thousands every time . Travelling by private jet is a growing trend , with 2.5 million private flights recorded in the US in 2013 ( the latest statistics ) and 705,000 in Europe . It a huge industry for the rich and famous , with its market worth $ 16.7trillion in the US and $ 15.8trillion in Europe . The busiest weekends unsurprisingly occur during huge sporting events , with the Super Bowl in America and the Monaco Grand Prix the priciest times of year to fly and the busiest weekends for private jets companies . Private jet companies such as PrivateFly were estimating costs from New York to Glendale for the Super Bowl this year at around $ 38,000 ( \u00a325,322 ) on a medium jet and $ 54,000 ( \u00a335,983 ) on a long-range jet for a round-trip . Salzburg Airport handled 1.6 million passengers in 2012 . It charges \u00a32,530 to land a 767-400 jet on its runways . For the Monaco Grand Prix in May , the trip is a more affordable \u00a38,835 ( $ 13,253 ) from London to Cannes and \u00a38,895 ( \u00a313,343 ) from London to Nice . 1 .

But if you want to fly into any of these 10 airports , you 'll be paying much more than that in landing fees . Website The Richest has compiled a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees , which are based on the 767-400 aircraft , which can hold up to 50 passengers but is often customised for private use . Surprisingly , the three most expensive airports for landing fees are in Japan . By far the most expensive airport is Haneda Airport , also known as Tokyo International Airport , where planes are charged a whopping \u00a34,559 ( $ 6,850 ) just for the privilege of landing . Welcoming almost 69million passengers a year , and still maintaining an incredibly high punctuality rating , it is perhaps understandable that fees can be high . Tokyo 's Narita International Airprot comes second , charging \u00a33,728 ( $ 5,600 ) , while Kansai International Airport in Osaka charges \u00a33,594 ( $ 5,400 ) per landing . Number eight on the list of the most expensive airport landing fees is Dublin Airport at \u00a32,729 . Somewhat surprisingly , the UK 's Bristol Airport makes it into the top 10 as the only British airport featured , charging \u00a32,929 ( $ 4,400 ) per private jet landing , just behind Toronto in Canada and Darwin , Australia . The only US airport to make it into the top 10 is LaGuardia , in New York , which charges $ 3,950 ( \u00a32,630 ) for private jets arriving in the city .

        "premise": "Wellth, a digital health startup intent on helping people with chronic conditions stick to their care plans, has raised $2 million in a new round of funding, according to a company statement. AXA Strategic Ventures led the round, but other investors participated including TB-Fore Capital, I2BF Venture Capital, Beta Bridge Ventures and AltaIR Capital. Wellth\u2019s app lets users track their medication adherence, register their weight and motivates them to strive to shift their lifestyles to make healthier choices with incentives. In response to emailed questions, Wellth CEO and Co-founder Matt Loper talked about its strategy and its newest investor, AXA Strategic Ventures. What kind of milestones are you hoping to meet with this new investment? This investment will allow us to have the capabilities to handle full scale commercial implementations. We have a number of planned launches lined up for the next 6 months and are excited to generate data on our interventions in a number of disease states including type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure, and post heart attack discharge. Our primary goal in the near term is to execute these implementations and publish data on our impact to adherence, health outcomes, and healthcare costs. What did you like about AXA\u2019s approach? We really like how hands-on and value add AXA Strategic Ventures has been. They have been instrumental in introducing us to all the relevant AXA business lines including US Life Insurance and ex-US health insurance, and making sure that we are solving for the actual needs of these business lines. Wellth is the first digital health investment they have made out of the US (previously the Paris office invested in Medlanes and BioBeats) but it is an area of focus for them and they are actively looking for other investments in the space. Who are your customers? How do they pay for the service? Our customers include any insurer or risk bearing provider, especially in the commercial and managed Medicaid markets. We work with them to quantify 12 month return-on-investment upfront in a fully transparent manner. In most cases we expect 4x+ returns. This actuarial model includes all expected incentive payouts and Wellth fees. We tend to charge on a per user basis and this fee is a small fraction of the projected cost savings. So many companies are trying different methods to effect behavior change, particularly for people with chronic conditions? Why will you succeed? There are a lot of companies trying to change chronic disease behavior and adherence, but behavior change is very tough and we believe that gamification, education, and connected devices do not solve the underlying issue of low patient motivation. So we leverage the growing body of behavioral economics research that proves that the right incentives structures are the most scalable and effective way to create the necessary motivation to create lasting behavior change. But we also go to great lengths to design an intuitive, painless user experience so that patients can stick with Wellth over time since it is so helpful and easy to use within their daily lives. You\u2019ve taken part in accelerators with Dreamit Ventures, Healthbox and New York Digital Health Accelerator. What\u2019s some of the best advice you have received from mentors? Michael Laskoff (who went on to join our Board of Directors) founded AbilTo which is a very successful behavior change company that counts many large health insurers as customers. He told me the story of how he got started and landed his first big national payer customer. It started with a very small implementation that went well for patients but produced almost no revenue. The payer customer was pretty pleased with the results and committed to expand AbilTo within their membership. After three months, the client had accomplished nothing. So, Michael walked in and fired them as a customer! The client couldn\u2019t believe that this tiny startup had fired their only large customer, but realized that they hadn\u2019t followed through with any of the agreed upon milestones. Today, that customer produces 10s of millions of recurring revenue for AbilTo.",

        "premise": "If you \u2019 re fed up with repeatedly typing passwords , hovering your finger on a sensor or staring at your phone waiting for it to scan your face to unlock it , a new device could cure your woes . The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby . The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of 10 feet ( three metres ) . Scroll down for video . Convenient : The Salt card ( pictured ) is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet , by automatically unlocking it whenever the user is nearby . Salt connects to an app on a user \u2019 s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet , where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored . The card was created by Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year , based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day . The duo , based in Chicago , Illinois , came up with the idea as an increased method of security and a time-saving device and recently raised more than $ 82,000 ( \u00a353,512 ) on Kickstarter to put it into production . The Salt card is made of durable plastic with a matte finish and is the same height and length as an ordinary credit card . However , it 's three times as thick because it has to be big enough to store the battery , which lasts for 18 months . The credit card-sized gadget ( illustrated ) also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range . It connects to an app on a user \u2019 s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet , where it is suggested the Salt card is stored . The start-up claims that its Salt card is more secure than fingerprint scanners , such as the one in Apple 's iPhone 6 handset ( pictured ) and it can be used with gloves in the winter . Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology . It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges , sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices . This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors , but it will also work even if the user \u2019 s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it , for example . Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year , but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with . Setting up the card is said to be simple , as users only have to enter the unique 12-digit code printed on the front of the card in the iOS or Android app to register it as their own . From then on , their phone automatically unlocks when they move within 10ft ( three metres ) of it . It does this thanks to a Bluetooth chip that emits a low-frequency signal that can be read by the phone , but does n't consume the battery , according to the start-up . \u2018 You do n't have to connect it your phone like you normally do with Bluetooth - it basically acts as a beacon and finds your phone , unlocking it , \u2019 Mr Paglione said . The card sends notifications to a user \u2019 s phone if they leave their wallet containing the card behind , as well as telling them the last location they had it . In the future it will be possible to change the proximity needed for the card to unlock the phone . \u2018 So you could set it for 30 feet ( 9 metres ) when you 're in your house so you do n't have to put in your pin at home , but when you 're out you might want it so it only unlocks when the card is in your hand , so you could set it to one foot proximity , \u2019 he explained . It is claimed that the card will save people around 53 hours over a year , based on the time it takes to type a password into their phone 150 times a day . The card costs $ 20 ( \u00a313 ) and can be ordered from the company \u2019 s website . Mr Paglione , 30 , said that as well as being tedious , constantly entering a password can be a security issue because criminals can spot a pattern and there are cameras everywhere . \u2018 Many people are looking for additional ways to secure their phone and people are always looking for ways to save time , \u2019 he said . However , it may appear that if a user 's handbag is stolen with their wallet including the card and their phone inside , Salt may prove less secure than a stanard password . MailOnline has asked the firm is this is the case . Mr Zistakis , an architect by profession , developed a prototype using a Bluetooth headset and then Mr Paglione added his manufacturing expertise to create the product . He conceded : \u2018 There are other people doing similar things , but the difference is we have put it into a device that can be hidden away and at $ 20 it 's very affordable . \u2018 The card is waterproof , so you could go swimming with it. \u2019 There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN , instead using biometric technology , such as fingerprint scanners and face scanners , to unlock their smartphones . The iPhone 6 , for example , has Touch ID , which enables users to unlock their handset by placing their finger on a button for a couple of seconds , while Fujitsu recently unveiled an iris scanner at Mobile World Congress that uses infrared light to unlock a handset . But the pair of Salt card inventors say that phone unlocking is just the beginning for them and in the future , they hope to develop the idea as a platform for communicating with all sorts of electronic devices . 'One day we 'd like the card to communicate with doors , unlocking as you approach them , lights turning on and off or you walk into a restaurant and you wo n't need to let them know you 've arrived , it 'll just book you in , Mr Paglione said . There are already key fobs that can unlock handsets and many people no longer input a PIN , instead using biometric technology such as fingerprint scanners and iris scanners ( illustrated ) to unlock their smartphones . Fujitsu has developed a \u2018 custom compact and high-output infrared LED \u2019 , and a custom infrared camera . These were combined with Fujitsu \u2019 s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology . It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris . The pattern doesn \u2019 t change significantly after the age of two , and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge . Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye \u2019 s openings larger or smaller , which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina . For its prototype , Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone . It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera . This pattern is registered and linked to the user . Each time they look at their phone , the sensor scans their eye , matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device . \u2018 The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations , \u2019 a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline . \u2018 This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance , rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require . \u2018 And in safety testing , the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes . \u2019",

        "premise": "Lloyds Banking Group has set aside a further \u00a31bn to pay compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). The extra provision was expected after the deadline for PPI claims was extended to June 2019 The announcement came as the bank announced that pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of September fell 15% to \u00a3811m. Total income for the quarter rose by 1% to \u00a34.27bn. Lloyds is 9% state-owned, but earlier this month the government said it was scrapping plans to sell its remaining shares in the bank to members of the public. It is now planning to sell its shares via a \"trading plan\", with small tranches of shares sold to institutional investors. The extra provision for PPI claims comes on top of the \u00a316bn Lloyds has already set aside to tackle PPI mis-selling. It is the bank worst affected by the PPI mis-selling scandal. In the third quarter, Lloyds also took a charge of \u00a3150m to cover the cost of other \"conduct issues\" - mostly related to the sale of packaged bank accounts. Underlying profit - before for the provisions for PPI compensation and the other conduct issues were taken into account - was \u00a31.91bn for the three-month period, down 3% on a year earlier. The bank said its net interest margin - the difference between the interest it gets from borrowers and what it pays savers - was 2.69% for the third quarter, down from 2.74% in the second quarter, \"partly reflecting the base rate change in early August\". That was when the Bank of England cut its key interest rate to 0.25% from 0.5% as it attempted to stimulate the UK economy in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Low interest rates have a negative impact on banks' performance, because it means they make less from long-term loans. \"The bank's net interest margin continues to be significantly hampered by the low interest rate environment, because it earns less of a turn on each \u00a31 it takes from depositors to lend out to borrowers, but at least that margin is holding steady,\" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Lloyds made a \u00a3204m provision to cover bad loans in the quarter, up from \u00a3157m a year earlier. However, it said the credit quality of its lending portfolio remained \"strong\". \"One positive offshoot of the low interest environment is that bad loans are still at exceptionally low levels, because debt is so affordable,\" said Mr Khalaf. In the nine months to the end of September, pre-tax profits were up by 52% to nearly \u00a33.3bn, while total income was little changed at \u00a313.15bn. \"The third-quarter figures are largely disappointing, whilst the nine months year-to-date performance is rather more impressive,\" said Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management. \"There are some concerning developments within the quarter, such as the additional PPI provision, an increase in impairments, the reduction in net interest margin and the overall profit decline. \"Meanwhile, as viewed as a proxy for the UK economy, the shares have been under pressure in anticipation of a hard Brexit, with all its negative connotations and with interest rates remaining at historic lows, the sector in general faces ongoing challenges.\" Shares closed down 0.96% at 55.88p.",

' He told historians that he did n't have the $ 175 the owner wanted , so he took a photo of it and then mailed it to historical groups in Savannah . Potter has now admitted the sham and explained how he falsified the image . When he was a teenager in Savannah , Potter , his brother Jeffrey and a friend shot a short 8mm movie about the building \u2014 and destruction \u2014 of the CSS Georgia in a fictional battle with Union troops . For the movie , they built an 18-foot long boat of plywood and Styrofoam , as well as a smaller 2-foot model . They based the design , in part , on his grandfather 's recollections of details passed down by word of mouth through generations of their family . Potter also used an illustration of the ironclad he found on a postcard . To create the fake image Potter 's younger brother put on a coat and straw hat went out to a marsh with a cane fishing pole and Potter took a photo . He took another photo of the 2-foot model and cut out the boat 's image , glued it onto the photo of his brother , then used dirt and glue to create the illusion of a photo faded by age and stained by water or chemicals . Evidence of the hoax : All elements of the fakery were snapped by Potter at one time . The small model boat here appears alongside the false picture , polaroids of it and a 1984 copy of Mad Magazine . He bought an old picture frame and beat it up even further . He put the photo in it . Then he drove 120 miles to a yard sale in Waycross , Georgia , put the picture down and took a Polaroid of it . He laughs now , when he remembers that it had seemed so important that he actually do this at a yard sale , so at least that part would be true . 'Who knows what goes through the mind of a kid , ' he said . The US Army Corps of Engineers appealed for information about the picture as it embarked on a project to raise the ironclad . Potter sent out the photo to historical groups , setting off the sporadic , and fruitless , search for a CSS Georgia photo that he now says never existed . As the Army Corps of Engineers embarked this year on a $ 14 million project to raise the wreckage of the real CSS Georgia from the river , archaeologists publicised the image online and in news stories hoping to track down the original photo . 'Wanted : A Photo Of This Confederate Battleship , ' read the headline above the image on the Army Corps website . 'There are a lot of characteristics in the photograph that lead us to believe it is the CSS Georgia , ' Julie Morgan , the Army Corps archaeologist in charge of raising the ironclad 's remains , said in a February interview . 'On the other side , there are some skeptics who believe it 's a complete fake . ' Robert Holcombe , former curator of the National Civil War Naval Museum in Columbus , Georgia , said in February that while the original photograph would be needed to confirm if the image was authentic , he believed it was real . 'Most people seem to think so , ' he said . 'Or else it 's an awfully good fake ' . The peeling gilt frame that once held the disputed photo , is now filled with a portrait of Potter 's deceased pug , Puggy Van Dug .

        "premise": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--California Resources Corporation (NYSE: CRC) today announced that it has executed and closed a purchase and sale agreement with Chevron to acquire the remaining working, surface and mineral interests in the 47,000-acre Elk Hills field in the San Joaquin Basin of California. Consolidating sole ownership of the Elk Hills field, CRC paid cash consideration of $460 million and issued 2.85 million CRC common shares to Chevron, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The effective date of the transaction was April 1, 2018. Todd Stevens, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \u201cThis acquisition is a natural fit that immediately accretes value to CRC, improving our cash flow and credit metrics. With a surface area larger than Washington, D.C., the Elk Hills field is our flagship asset. We have operated this field for over 20 years and have developed a deep knowledge of the geology and strong operational expertise to deliver robust value from this asset. We intend to apply this know-how to our newly acquired position, as well as transfer learnings and efficiencies to enhance CRC\u2019s assets across California. We would like to thank Chevron for their partnership over the past 20 years. Acquiring sole ownership of such a prolific field is an ideal use of proceeds from our recent midstream joint venture transaction, adding both immediate production and cash flow, while providing for quick synergies and tremendous long-term development opportunities.\u201d The acquisition includes Chevron\u2019s non-operated working interests ranging between 20% to 22% in different producing horizons within the Elk Hills field. In 2017, the acquired interests produced approximately 13,300 barrels of equivalent (BOE) per day with 46% oil and 9% natural gas liquids. CRC estimates that if it had owned 100% of the field last year, these interests would have added approximately 64 million BOE of proved reserves at year-end 2017, of which approximately 75% are considered proved developed. CRC estimates that these interests would have generated approximately $100 million of annual operating cash flow in 2017 assuming current prices. CRC now owns Elk Hills in fee simple, the most complete form of ownership, holding a 100% working interest and a 100% net revenue interest, as well as all surface lands in the Elk Hills field. The field has an estimated 8.5 billion BOE of original oil in place and 32 major producing zones currently identified. CRC expects to achieve approximately $5 million of annualized operational savings within six months of closing and approximately $15 million of additional synergies within the next 18 months as it streamlines processes and leverages its substantial infrastructure already in place. Elk Hills is CRC\u2019s lowest cost operating area and with a 100% ownership interest would have accounted for approximately 43% of its 2017 pro-forma production. Because of the low operating costs at Elk Hills, this acquisition will immediately reduce CRC\u2019s corporate per unit production costs by approximately $0.55 per BOE, in addition to lowering general and administrative costs by about $0.20 per BOE. Additional information regarding the transaction described above is available in CRC\u2019s latest corporate presentation on the \u201cEarnings and Presentations\u201d page in the Investor Relations section on www.crc.com. About Elk Hills Field The Elk Hills Field is a world-class onshore asset located 20 miles southwest of Bakersfield in Kern County. The field, covering nearly 75 square miles, was discovered in 1911 and has produced over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), making it one of the most productive fields in the United States. During 2017, we produced 48,000 BOE per day (37 percent of CRC\u2019s total production) on average from our 3,000 wells at Elk Hills. At year-end 2017, CRC\u2019s approximate 78% interest in Elk Hills had proved reserves of 206 million BOE, of which 75% are considered proved developed. Elk Hills is the largest natural gas and natural gas liquids field in California, generating over half of the state\u2019s natural gas production. About California Resources Corporation California Resources Corporation is the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production company in California on a gross-operated basis. The Company operates its world class resource base exclusively within the State of California, applying complementary and integrated infrastructure to gather, process and market its production. Using advanced technology, California Resources Corporation focuses on safely and responsibly supplying affordable energy for California by Californians.

But a court in the country 's capital Cairo acquitted the 63-year-old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty . Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges , with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail . Scroll down for video . Jailed : Egypt 's former president Mohamed Morsi ( pictured at an court appearance in December ) has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012 . But the court cleared the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5 , 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo . Defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions . Morsi , Egypt 's first freely elected leader , came to power following the 2011 ouster of Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising . But after just a year in power , Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests . Morsi 's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail . Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday 's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected . 'This is a surprise ... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder , ' Ramy Ghanem , a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes , told AFP . Buses were set ablaze during 2012 clashes between opponents and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . 'But the sentences are not bad . We were expecting life in prison , but then 20 years is not very different , ' he said . A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years . Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called 'unprecedented in recent history ' . Earlier this month , a Cairo court confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence . The Brotherhood had called for protests in support of Morsi on Tuesday . 'The coup commander is exploiting the judiciary , ' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict , referring to Sisi . It said the president was using the courts 'as a weapon in the battle against the popular will and the democratic and revolutionary legitimacy represented by President Mohamed Morsi . ' Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty , including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers . Verdicts in those two cases are due on May 16 . Sisi has vowed to 'eradicate ' the Brotherhood , an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak 's fall and Morsi 's presidential election victory in May 2012 . Supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood clashed during 2012 street battles in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . The authorities designated it a 'terrorist group ' in December 2013 , making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms . The crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups , who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces . Officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since Morsi was overthrown . Sisi was elected president in May last year , but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by Mubarak 's ouster of a civilian democracy . Sisi 's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth .

        "premise": "SHANGHAI -- Though a closely watched gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity is expected to point to continued growth, some observers see the risk that the public-private projects supporting the world's second-largest economy are storing up problems for the future. The average market forecast predicts that the January reading of China's official manufacturing purchasing managers index, to be announced Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics and Purchases, will come to 51.2. This would be roughly flat with December's 51.4 and above the psychologically important threshold of 50, which separates growth from contraction. \"Demand for funds among companies involved in construction machinery, automobiles and robotics is stronger than expected,\" said a source at the Chinese unit of a major Japanese bank. Because the Chinese economy is heavily dependent on the property market, some have worried that greater regulation of housing sales could trigger a slowdown. But loan requests from manufacturers have been rising since November, according to the banker. China's PMI hit a two-year high of 51.7 in November. Though it has dipped since, the market consensus sees the figure remaining above 50 for some time. The government is expected to set its economic growth target for 2017 at about 6.5%, and a sudden loss of momentum seems unlikely. \"They're not purposefully going to do something that could look bad for the Communist Party leadership in a party congress year,\" said Mihoko Hosokawa, a research executive at Mizuho Bank, referring to the gathering held every five years to determine the party's top leaders. While the Chinese economy seems to be on solid ground, a closer look reveals some cracks. Shares in China State Construction International Holdings rallied earlier this month after the state-run group won a contract to build highways in the city of Liupanshui, Guizhou Province. The Hong Kong-listed issue jumped more than 8% at one point on Jan. 11, and hit a roughly one-year high on Jan. 19. Under such public-private partnerships, companies gain operating rights for a time to the infrastructure they build in exchange for shouldering construction costs. This allows governments to make public investments without expanding its debt. China's regional governments together carried 17 trillion yuan ($2.47 trillion) in debt at the end of 2016. The central government is discouraging them from adding to this pile, instead urging them to mobilize private money for investments. Over 10,000 PPPs worth a total of 12.73 trillion yuan had been approved by the end of December, according to the finance ministry. Private finance initiatives have caught on in Japan, too. But in China, there is concern that PPPs merely shunt debt from regional governments to companies. Many of the projects involve roads, parking lots and public facilities with cash flows that look good on paper. But there is no guarantee they will generate the expected revenue. Some say many of China's highways are operating at a loss, and that only links between Beijing and Shanghai are reliably profitable. Most companies involved in PPPs are state-run. Beijing relied on regional governments to fund much of a 4 trillion yuan stimulus package rolled out in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. Now that their coffers are considerably ligther, the central government appears to be drawing instead on corporate balance sheets. The yuan rebounded more than 1% against the dollar in January after a series of bare-knuckled measures by authorities -- like requiring individuals to submit applications in order to exchange money -- meant to stop the Chinese currency's plunge. \"Regulations have only delayed yuan-selling, which there is still great demand for, and concerns over capital flight remain,\" said a banking source. The Chinese economy is still saddled with two weaknesses: growing debt and a weak yuan.",

        "premise": "All of the major banks in the UK are now running customer engagement programmes to inform their clients about Libor transition generally, identify the issues that clients might want to focus on and offer solutions (this third point is somewhat behind the other two, but should start to catch up over the coming months as new products are brought to market). Conduct risk is broadly defined by the FCA as any action of a financial institution or individual that leads to customer detriment or has an adverse effect on market stability or effective competition. The FCA has deliberately set out a very wide definition of conduct risk, leaving the onus on financial services firms to prove how they are protecting customers. This is in recognition of the perceived imbalance of power between banks and their clients in this process. In preparation for transitioning legacy transactions, treasurers should focus on infrastructure. Firstly, systems: Treasury management systems (TMS) providers are working on providing solutions that will enable the booking of transactions that have interest that compounded in arrears (that being how many of the replacement risk-free reference (RFR) benchmarks are expected to work), but they cannot finalise system changes until there is greater clarity around market conventions. Corporates should talk to their TMS providers (remembering that most TMS vendors will only provide updates for the later versions of their software) but also consider how they might need to resource and time any updates to their systems. IT consultants will likely be in high demand as transition picks up speed, and many corporates have periods in the year where systems updates are not permitted (for example, over year end). Secondly, the mechanics of how to transition transactions from Libor to a replacement benchmark \u2013 specifically documentation \u2013 must be addressed. This can be split into: Re-documenting transactions is not straightforward as Libor has both term and bank credit factored into it unlike an RFR so a credit spread adjustment will also be required \u2013 and how that\u2019s to be calculated is still something of an unknown. As is the case with IT consultants, lawyers are another group likely to be in demand as transition builds pace, so it\u2019s worth talking to yours sooner rather than later. So, to summarise, while it may still feel like Libor transition is \u2018a long way off\u2019, or \u2018may never happen\u2019, neither is accurate. Corporates need to follow the banks\u2019 lead and start to engage now in the process. If nothing else, they need to make sure that they are prepared for when things pick up speed.

        "premise": "Magazine giant Hearst is rolling out its native digital ad product to all 84 of its markets, buoyed by the success it has had in the U.S. Hearst\u2019s \u201cshared spaces\u201d product lets advertisers inhabit the same area as editorial content. It launched in the U.K. in January and will be implemented in all Hearst properties by the end of the first half of this year. After that, it will expand to Asia. \u201cThe way we get the smaller markets to transform quickly based off a very successful U.S. model is an interesting business challenge,\u201d said Andy Hart, who joined the company last September as chief revenue officer and senior vp of Hearst Media International, is spearheading the global rollout. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking a scaled model and adapting it to different-sized countries and cultures, all in different development phases,\u201d he said. Hearst isn\u2019t known as a brand that has nailed the transition from print to digital-first publishing businesses among agencies. But the global native-ad rollout signals a \u201cpositive shift\u201d and an important revenue driver, particularly as brands look to connect with their audiences in deeper ways beyond programmatic and reservation media, said Essence head of planning and mobile Erfan Djazmi. \u201cBrands must be careful of not falling into the pitfall of \u2018ticking the native advertising box\u2019 and will want to move beyond advertorials and sponsored posts into co-created editorial,\u201d he said. \u201cThe success depends on how well editorial content is matched to brand messaging, which makes the content valuable and meaningful to the user.\u201d Hart was previously vp of advertising and online for Europe at Microsoft and, prior to that, launched the now highly successful MailOnline. One of his top priorities is finding ways to get the smaller markets to transform digitally. That\u2019s why it is quickening the rollout of media OS and Shared Spaces products \u2014 the latter of which Hart believes will catalyze the publisher\u2019s native ad revenue. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the same challenges all digital publishers face: distributed audience, ad blocking, viewability, changing trust models in the commercial model, challenging subscription models in terms of consumers expecting stuff for free, and diminishing attention spans,\u201d he added. The legacy publisher is home to nearly 300 print magazines (19 in the U.K.) including Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Esquire, and more than 250 sites across 84 countries. Transitioning a print legacy company of that size to the fast-paced world of digital media is tough. But Hearst is confident it has achieved that, in the U.S. at least. And a large part of it has been due to its investment in technology, namely, its \u201cmedia operating system\u201d through which its U.S. news desk can constantly comb through stories across the publisher\u2019s network of sites to identify which stories would work well on other sites. Roughly 20 percent of a site\u2019s content usually comes from one of its other titles. The publisher claims that digital revenue has risen 35 percent in the U.S. since full rollout and that unique visitors to its sites grew by nearly 50 percent.

        "premise": "Senegalese fintech startup MaTontine has launched a nationwide pilot with the World Bank\u2019s Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), aiming to roll out innovative solutions that accelerate the way innovation improves and expands financial services for low-income populations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Established in 2015, MaTontine has automated the traditional savings circles found throughout Africa, and built a software platform that enables it to work with a range of partners to provide access to small loans and related financial services for the financially excluded. \u201cThe problem we are trying to solve is an enduring and challenging one: how to unlock access to financial services like small loans to the poor at scale. The banks and micro-finance institutions have realised that they cannot do this profitably at scale with their current infrastructure,\u201d MaTontine managing director Bernie Akporiaye told Disrupt Africa. \u201cIt turns out that it\u2019s actually very difficult to profitably make small loans like US$100. Consequently, for our members the only providers of these type of loans charge between 25 per cent and 100 per cent per annum.\u201d MaTontine \u2013 which was recently named the winner of the Senegalese leg of the global Seedstars World startups competition \u2013 solves this problem by utilising mobile phones and its platform to digitise the benefits of traditional savings groups, reducing the cost of borrowing by 75 per cent or more. \u201cFor our solution, we went back about century to a system used all over the developing world. It is called Tontines in Francophone Africa; the industry term is Rotating Savings and Credit Associations,\u201d Akporiaye said. Here\u2019s how it works. A group of, say, 10 people, each with its own manager, contributes, say, US$10 every month into a pot. At the end of the month one member of the group collects the pot of US$100. This cycle repeats itself until everybody has won the US$100 pot. \u201cOur innovation is to build a digital platform that automates this whole process and incorporates a credit scoring system in order for us to facilitate small loans and other financial services like micro-insurance from our partners based on the credit score of our members. All financial transactions are done digitally using mobile phones and mobile money,\u201d Akporiaye said. MaTontine is now ready to make this innovation readily available through its pilot with the World Bank\u2019s CGAP, testing how the digitisation of traditional savings circles and the use of mobile payments can significantly improve the delivery of financial products and services at scale to women and the rural poor in Senegal. For the six-month pilot, the startup is teaming up with payment providers like Yup and Wari, financial institutions such as COFINA and Manko, and insurance providers like SUNU Assurances Vie and PMAS. \u201cUp until recently we were self-funded. We have however accepted grant funding from the World Bank,\u201d Akporiaye said. \u201cIn December 2016 we completed our last pilot, with 2,000 members including 475 active ones, to which we have granted small loans for a total amount of US$12,000, with a default rate of zero per cent. We have a goal of acquiring at least 10,000 members by the end of the year.\u201d Currently only operating in Senegal, MaTontine does have plans to expand throughout Francophone Africa, starting with Ivory Coast next year. Access to the platform is free, with the startup generating revenues through commissions from partners who offer products such as loans and insurance.",

The eccentrically-disguised man entered a branch of the U.S Bank in the city of Santa Cruz at around 3pm last Friday and handed the cashier a note demanding money . His blonde wig , female clothing , glasses and purse immediately prompted comparisons with Mrs Doubtfire from the 1993 movie of the same name in which Robin Williams played a divorcee who dresses as an elderly female nanny to spend more time with his children . Cross-dresser : The eccentrically-disguised man entered a branch of the U.S Bank in the city of Santa Cruz at around 3pm last Friday and handed the cashier a note demanding money . Santa Cruz Police Department released the surveillance images yesterday as they stepped up their efforts to find the cross-dressing bankrobber . The 25 to 35-year-old man made off with an unknown sum of money after the U.S. Bank employee responded to his demand without raising the alarm . No weapon was used or mentioned during the robber and nobody was injured , according to the San Jose Mercury . Authorities searched the area around the bank shortly afterwards , but he was not found . Lieutenant Bernie Escalante said a man wearing exactly the same outfit had been seen 'acting suspiciously ' outside a nearby Rabobank roughly an hour before the U.S. Bank robbery .

Uncanny : The bankrobber 's blonde wig , female clothing and spectacles prompted comparisons with Mrs Doubtfire from the 1993 movie of the same name starring the late Robin Williams . Santa Cruz police said the man appeared to be aged between 25 and 35 , was about five foot five inches tall and weighed 160-170 pounds .

'We believe these are great photos of the suspect , and somebody in the community has to recognize this person , ' Lt Escalante said as he urged anyone with information to contact his officers . Mrs Doubtfire was released in 1993 to mixed reviews from critics but was a massive box office hit - only falling behind Jurassic Park as the highest-grossing film of the year .

On June 19, Marriott Caribbean & Latin America Resorts launched its brand-new \u201cPortal to Paradise\u201d app, allowing consumers the chance to explore and uncover a new destination from the palm of their hand. \u201cWith the Portal to Paradise app, we want consumers to be able to explore places that either they might not have previously considered, or ones they\u2019ve always been interested in seeing, and in a first, users only need their iPhone, and no secondary technology or device, to \u2018visit\u2019 eight of our beautiful resorts in some of the Caribbean and Mexico\u2019s most sought-after locations,\u201d said Diana Plazas, Vice President of Brand, Marketing & Digital \u2013 Caribbean and Latin America, Marriott International.

        "premise": "Bias is a well-established problem in artificial intelligence (AI) and is typical of models trained on unrepresentative datasets. It\u2019s a tougher challenge to solve than you might think, particularly in image classification tasks where racial, societal, and ethnic prejudices frequently rear their ugly heads. In a crowdsourced attempt to combat the problem, Google partnered with the NeurIPS competition track in September to launch the Inclusive Images Competition. This challenges teams to use Open Images \u2014 a publicly available dataset of 900 labeled images sampled from North America and Europe \u2014 to train an AI system evaluated on photos collected from regions around the world. It\u2019s hosted on Kaggle, Google\u2019s data science and machine learning community portal. Pallavi Baljekar, a Google Brain researcher, gave a progress update this morning during a presentation on algorithmic fairness. \u201c[Image classification] performance \u2026 has [been] improving drastically \u2026 over the last few years \u2026 [and] has almost surpassed human performance [on some datasets]\u201d Baljekar said. \u201c[But we wanted to] see how well the models [did] on real-world data.\u201d To that end, Google AI scientists set a pretrained Inception v3 model loose on the Open Images dataset. One photo \u2014 a caucasian bride in a Western-style, long and full-skirted wedding dress \u2014 resulted in labels like \u201cdress,\u201d \u201cwomen,\u201d \u201cwedding,\u201d and \u201cbride.\u201d However, another image \u2014 also of a bride, but of Asian descent and in ethnic dress \u2014 produced labels like \u201cclothing,\u201d \u201cevent,\u201d and \u201cperformance art.\u201d Worse, the model completely missed the person in the image. \u201cAs we move away from the Western presentation of what a bride looks like \u2026 the model is not likely to [produce] image labels as a bride,\u201d Baljekar said. Above: Wedding photographs labeled by a classifier trained on the Open Images dataset. Image Credit: Google AI The reason is no mystery. Comparatively few of the photos in the Open Images dataset are from China, India, and the Middle East. And research has already shown that computer vision systems are susceptible to racial bias. A 2011 study found that AI developed in China, Japan, and South Korea had more trouble distinguishing between Caucasian faces than East Asians, and in a separate study conducted in 2012 facial recognition algorithms from vendor Cognitec performed 5 to 10 percent worse on African Americans than on Caucasians. More recently, a House oversight committee hearing on facial recognition technologies revealed that algorithms used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to identify criminal suspects are wrong about 15 percent of the time, while Amazon\u2018s Rekognition program misidentified 28 members of Congress as criminals, with a strong bias against individuals of color. The Inclusive Images Competition\u2019s goal, then, was to spur competitors to develop image classifiers for scenarios where data collection would be difficult \u2014 if not impossible. To compile a diverse dataset against which submitted models could be evaluated, Google AI used an app that instructed users to take pictures of objects around them and generated captions using on-device machine learning. The captions were converted into action labels and passed through an image classifier, which were verified by a human team. A second verification step ensured people were properly labeled in images. In the first of two competition stages, during which 400 teams participated, Google AI released 32,000 images of diverse data sampled from different geolocations and label distributions from the Open Image data. In the second stage, Google released 100,000 images with different labels and geographical distributions from the first stage and training dataset. Above: Examples of labeled images from the challenge dataset. Image Credit: Google AI So what were the takeaways? The top three teams used a combination of networks and data augmentation techniques, and their AI systems maintained relatively high accuracy in both stage one and stage two. And while four out of five of the top teams\u2019 models didn\u2019t predict the \u201cbride\u201d label when applied to the original two bride images, they did recognize a person in the images. \u201cEven with a small, diverse set of data, we can improve performance on unseen target distributions,\u201d Baljekar said. Google AI will release a 500,000-image diverse dataset on December 7.",

        "premise": "( CNN ) They come from more than 20 countries , drawn to Libya as the funnel to Europe . Eritreans want to escape repression or military service ; Somalis flee Al-Shabaab and clan warfare ; Syrians have given up hope of returning home . In villages in Senegal and elsewhere across West Africa , young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in Europe , perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it . Motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the Mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved , according to researchers and human rights groups . But in 2014 more than 80 % of them headed for the Libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation . From the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic , from Syria and Gaza , these would-be migrants travel well-established smuggling routes . Along the way they must cross deserts and mountains , risk kidnap or robbery , are often cheated or left stranded . One African migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days . A teenage Somali who made it to Malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come . `` I tell them its 95 % sure that you will die , '' he said . The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) has tracked the migrant flows through North Africa for years . Eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers , escaping an authoritarian government , poverty and indefinite military service -- a land without possibilities . `` Many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention , torture , or punishment of their families , '' according to a report by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat ( RMMS ) in Nairobi last year . They travel to Sudan , so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border , and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay . One Eritrean woman told the UN Refugee agency ( UNHCR ) this month that she had paid $ 5,000 to reach the Mediterranean . Eritreans and Syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to Europe last year , according to Arezo Malakooti , director of migration research at Altai Consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns . Malakooti has recently visited seven countries , including Libya , Tunisia and Morocco to update her study . The `` push factor '' is much greater than the `` pull '' of Europe , she says . Upheavals and instability across much of Africa and the Middle East -- combined with the perception that Libya 's doors are open -- have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach Libya . `` Worsening repression in Eritrea '' has been one factor , she says -- while Eritreans already in refugee camps in Sudan have decided to make a dash for the Mediterranean . One reason is that other routes -- through Saudi Arabia and to Israel -- have become more difficult : Israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would-be Eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the Sinai desert , including detention , and Yemen 's implosion has cut off that conduit . As one Eritrean told the humanitarian journal IRIN last year : `` People were traveling to Israel because it was the only way , and now they 're traveling to Europe because it 's the only way . '' Somalis , often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the Mediterranean , face a perfect storm of crises . `` Extreme poverty ; prolonged insecurity ; sexual violence and other serious human rights violations ; lack of access to basic needs such as food , medical services , healthcare and livelihoods '' are all contributory factors , says the RMMS . Sea-tossed storm of human misery hits Italian shores . The IOM told CNN it is seeing a spike in would-be migrants from Senegal , Mali , Guinea and Gambia in West Africa . Many reason that Libya 's chaos is an opportunity : border posts are left abandoned , the coastline unguarded . Most West Africans make the journey for economic reasons ; the majority are single men in their twenties . Populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking . Often , say researchers , the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home -- perhaps misled by fables of riches . Malakooti noted in a recent report that `` unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed . '' But West Africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home : 400 Senegalese were recently repatriated from Libya by the Red Cross and IOM . Malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before French-led intervention pushed them back . Joel Millman of the IOM says there 's also been an increase in the number of Nigerian Christians following this route , escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by Boko Haram . Another disturbing phenomenon , according to Malakooti , is the trafficking of African women for prostitution to Italy through Libya . While still a small fraction of the overall migration , the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in Europe rose threefold in 2014 , she says . Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy . A Geneva-based group , the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime , estimated last year that about half of West African migrants pass through the town of Agadez in northern Niger . A crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving Agadez stemmed the flow for a while , but gangs from the Toubou tribe , which controls the cross-border trade , developed new routes and raised their prices . A migrant might pay as much as $ 300 to reach southern Libya in a truck or pick-up , according to researchers . Reliable figures on the numbers passing through Agadez are difficult to come by , but the consensus among experts is somewhere between 2,000 and 7,000 every month . Other hubs include Khartoum in Sudan , a way-station for migrants from East Africa , and Tamanrasset in southern Algeria , where a fake Malian passport aids passage . Algeria has also been a destination for Syrian refugees , but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through Turkey and the Greek islands . Hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in Libya for years , attracted to jobs as day laborers when Moammar Gadhafi was in power . Now they face violence , discrimination and religious persecution -- and are unable even to remit home what little they earn . So at least some are embarking on a journey to Europe they never intended to take . Malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach Europe . The recent murder of Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians by ISIS 's Libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some . A similar dynamic applies to Syrian refugees . `` Initially , they remained in Lebanon , Jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict , '' says Malakooti . Now they 've given up , or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated -- and have decided to try to reach Europe and start over . Within Libya , the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks , according to human rights organizations . They cluster in dusty towns such as Sabha and Qatrun and use what are known as 'connection houses . ' How is Europe going to tackle migrant crisis . Those driving migrants to Tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast . Such a journey , across the desert to avoid checkpoints , might cost a migrant $ 200 : in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries . Tribal feuds , roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler . The arrival of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) in Libya has further complicated passage ; in January jihadists killed 14 Libyan soldiers near Sabha . Malakooti detects a changing pattern since the Syrian conflict began . It has injected more money into the smuggling business , which has therefore become more organized . The more reliable groups can charge more ; she says some migrants buy a `` package '' from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel . Syrian migrants are relatively better off than West Africans , and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel . Africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks , or consigned to an inflatable dinghy . Fearing arrest , the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves , instead giving a compass or GPS device to the migrants , who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port . As Libya becomes more dangerous for migrants , other countries on both sides of the Mediterranean are looking on anxiously . Some West Africans opt to travel through Morocco -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to Spain very difficult . `` A migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the Spanish coast , '' says Malakooti . Tunisia has massively increased security along its eastern border with Libya ; both Algeria and Morocco have begun building fences along their border -- against both terrorism and clandestine migration . But they may be little deterrent . The Eritrean writer Abu Bakr Khaal made the desperate voyage to and across the Mediterranean himself . In his novel `` African Titanics , '' he describes the `` dangerous lure '' of escape . Only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea : . `` 'If God loved me he would not have brought me here , ' groaned one of the passengers .

In April 2013 , the Spanish manager declared that Terry could no longer play two games a week and that controversial decision , twinned with a persistent knee injury , meant the former England international made just 14 appearances for his beloved in the 2012-13 campaign . Fast forward to 2015 , the Blues captain has one hand on the Premier League trophy after arguably his most impressive season at the club - during which he has played a part in each of their 33 games so far . Chelsea captain John Terry is on course to appear in all 38 Premier League matches for his side this season . The Blues captain has made an appearance in all 33 Premier League games for Chelsea so far this season . It 's an impressive tally for the 34-year-old , who will no doubt be hoping he can mark another memorable season with a personal best of having featured in all 38 Premier League games come the end of the season . If Terry manages to make appearances in all of Chelsea 's remaining fixtures against Leicester , Crystal Palace , Liverpool , West Brom and Sunderland , he will beat the 37 domestic appearances he made during his side 's last title-winning season in 2009-10 . And he made 36 in 2004-05 and again the following season - his other two Premier League title triumphs .

        "premise": "PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The battle over how and where Europeans charge their electric cars is expanding from the continent\u2019s cities to its motorways. An electric car is being charged in a Paris street, France, September 12, 2017. Picture taken September 12, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer Power utilities, tech start-ups and oil majors are fighting to establish themselves as the dominant players in the fast-growing business of charging stations \u2013 but advances in electric vehicles means where they build them is changing. Refuelling conventional petrol and diesel cars on motorways has long been the domain of the oil companies, which typically have their own networks of filling stations. Several are now talking about setting up high-power charging networks, creating major competition for limited space at motorway service areas. \u201cIt is a bit of a landgrab now to win this sector,\u201d said Tim Payne, chief executive of British charging start-up InstaVolt, which has raised 12 million pounds to install 3,000 charge points across Britain by 2020. WATCH: Green the theme of Frankfurt Auto Show While the range of electric vehicles (EVs) was less than 100 km (60 miles), Europe\u2019s utilities were happy to help cities and companies install slow and inexpensive charging points at homes, offices and shops, often supported by state subsidies. But Tesla (TSLA.O), Porsche (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) are now making battery-powered cars with enough range to drive across countries. Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen also announced plans on the eve of this week\u2019s Frankfurt motor show to accelerate their shift to electric cars. Charging infrastructure remains nowhere near it needs to be. \u201cWhere is the network of charging points that will be required? Indeed where is the power and the grid?\u201d Ralf Speth, boss of Britain\u2019s Jaguar Land Rover, asked last week. Experts including ChargePoint and Engie (ENGIE.PA) are, however, making plans to build pan-European networks of high-voltage fast-charging stations which can refill a battery in less than half an hour instead of overnight. In Britain, InstaVolt is renting land from filling station operators, bringing them additional revenue from the lease as well as the increased traffic to their shops at the sites. It earns a margin by selling power through the chargers. InstaVolt struck a deal in May with ChargePoint, which itself is on a $125 million expansion spree in Europe, to install about 200 of the U.S. group\u2019s ultra-fast chargers close to popular roads across Britain. Morgan Stanley estimates that 1-3 million public charging points could be needed in western Europe by 2030, adding that while utilities have natural skills in the new industry, it was too early to determine who will come put on top. \u201cThe winning business model is up for grabs,\u201d it said. Today, there are fewer than 100,000 public charging points available in Europe, with only about six percent of them fast, according to the International Energy Agency. Almost none of these is super-fast, a term usually used for charging stations with an output of at least 150 kilowatts. More than three times faster than current-generation chargers, they are now being targeted by those trying to become market leaders. Contenders include Dutch EV-Box, one of Europe\u2019s biggest makers of charging stations, which was snapped up by French utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) in March. \u201cWe expect hundreds of millions of annual revenue from EV-Box in a few years,\u201d Thierry Lepercq, head of innovation at Engie, told Reuters. He sees Engie\u2019s EV charging revenue growing by a factor of 20 in three to five years. Last year, EV-Box had sales of 16 million euros ($19.1 million). EV-Box Chief Executive Kristof Vereenooghe said that unlike most of its competitors EV-Box has been profitable from the start, a claim that makes it stand out in an industry where gaining scale is considered more important for now. That\u2019s why German utility E.ON (EONGn.DE), too, announced a strategic partnership with Danish startup CLEVER and said it had the ambition to roll out several hundred ultra-fast charging stations along European motorways. CLEVER, which is owned by a group of Danish utilities and runs charging networks in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, wants to extend its network to France, Britain and Italy with E.ON. The firm, which unlike EV-Box and ChargePoint does not make its own hardware, is also still looking for other partners. \u201cWe want to connect cities so that you can easily drive across Europe in an electric vehicle,\u201d CLEVER Chief Executive Casper Kirketerp-Moeller said. Among the oil majors, BP (BP.L), Shell (RDSa.L) and (TOTF.PA) have all either announced plans or launched pilot projects for EV charging. Few people, however, expect them to become serious contenders for a business that would effectively curb demand for their chief product: oil. BP did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Shell said it did not make economic sense yet to equip petrol stations fully with EV charging points. \u201cPeople like Shell and Total talk a lot, but nothing happens. We are putting the grid connection in place,\u201d said Michiel Langezaal, founder and chief executive of Fastned, which has 63 EV charging stations in the Netherlands. Leasing plots of land, the group wants to raise 100 million euros over the next two years to branch out into Germany, Belgium, France and Britain. So far it gets the stations from Swiss ABB (ABBN.S) but is also in talks with ChargePoint. Unlike utilities and charging station startups, electric vehicle makers see fast charging networks not as a profit centre, but as a loss-leader needed to persuade customers that electric vehicles can drive across continents. That seems to work for some. Tesla, for example, operates a proprietary charging network throughout Europe, mainly in hotels, but it is stretched thinly - in the Ile de France region around Paris it has just a handful of \u201csuperchargers\u201d. This year, the group\u2019s market valuation surpassed that of General Motors (GM.N), making it the biggest U.S. carmaker by that measure. \u201cTesla has never been in the black, but had enormous growth,\u201d said Elke Temme, who co-heads the e-mobility unit of Germany\u2019s Innogy (IGY.DE). \u201cGoing forward, however, the business must pay off.\u201d",

The document revealed the Party 's ideological battle plan to counter advocates of constitutional democracy , banning public discussions on topics ranging from press freedom , civil rights to judicial independence . `` There is no defense against state secret charges in China , anything the Party or the government want to label as state secrets will be labeled and treated as such -- they can even do it retroactively , '' said Nicholas Bequelin , the Hong Kong-based East Asia director of Amnesty International . `` Her sentencing is in line with the very stern approach President Xi Jinping 's team has taken on dissent , information control and challenges to the Party , '' he added . Beijing police detained Gao in late April of last year -- ahead of the sensitive 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown -- and state broadcaster CCTV soon aired her `` confession '' on national television . Expressing `` deep remorse '' in the video , Gao told interrogators she `` deeply regretted that her behavior had harmed national interests and violated the law . '' Mo , her lawyer , said the authorities had extracted the confession by threatening her son 's safety and released the police video to CCTV without her knowledge . He added the alleged recipient of the leaked document even publicly denied that Gao was his source . An outspoken journalist and press freedom advocate , Gao began her career as a reporter for the state-run China News Service in 1979 and , in recent years , had been writing columns for overseas Chinese-language publications . She was arrested after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and released more than a year later . She was imprisoned for another six years for leaking state secrets in 1993 -- though the government has never disclosed details of that case . Since Xi took power over two years ago , his government has jailed hundreds of activists across China despite rising international concern . `` We are in the midst of one of the most severe crackdowns on human rights activists , '' said Bequelin of Amnesty International . `` What the state used to tolerate , it does n't tolerate anymore .

        "premise": "DUBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As the Gulf states take steps to expand their use of clean energy, a bold plan by the United Arab Emirates to boost its use of renewable electricity from less than 1 percent to 24 percent in the next five years could be a game-changer for the region, experts say. Men stand in front of solar panels at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, November 28, 2015. REUTERS/Stringer Much of the world is moving away from oil for its electricity generation, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which says that globally the fossil fuel has dropped from a 25 percent share to 3.6 percent over the last four decades. Countries in the Middle East, however, have been bucking the trend. The IEA predicts that by 2019, the region \u2013 which holds one-third of the world\u2019s proven crude oil reserves \u2013 will still be generating nearly one-third of its electricity from oil, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia leading the way. But dropping oil prices and growing concerns about climate change have exposed the downsides of relying on oil. As the Gulf\u2019s demand for power continues to rise, the UAE is leading the way in shifting to greener energy resources. \u201cThe implications of unmitigated climate change for the UAE make its cities unbearably hot, water even more scarce and the region more unstable,\u201d Rachel Kyte, the CEO of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Energy for All initiative, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cAction alone and collectively to live in balance with the planet is fundamental for UAE\u2019s future prosperity,\u201d she said. At the Middle East and North Africa Renewable Energy Conference in Kuwait last month, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states \u2013 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 pledged to mobilize $100 billion into renewable energy projects over the next 20 years. One of the projects in the UAE\u2019s renewables push is the $13.6 billion Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, which aims to become the biggest solar power plant in the Middle East. It is expected to generate 5 gigawatts of electricity \u2013 enough to power 1.5 million homes \u2013 by 2030. Dubai also plans to install around 100 electric car charging stations as part of its Green Charger Initiative. By 2050, Dubai wants to reduce its carbon emissions by 6.5 million tons every year, with the aim of becoming the city with the world\u2019s lowest carbon footprint, according to the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has said it wants to add another 9.5 GW of renewable energy capacity to its current capacity of 80 GW by 2030, And Oman\u2019s power sector regulator, the Authority for Electricity Regulation Oman, has announced it will expand rooftop soar installations across residential homes, industrial and commercial buildings. In Qatar, French energy giant Total SA has announced a joint venture worth $500 million with state-run petroleum, electricity and water companies to develop a solar-power project with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts (MW). And with a 70 MW solar project due to be operational by 2017, Kuwait plans to meet 15 percent of its energy needs with renewables by 2030, according to the Kuwait Institute of Scientific Research. \u201cDiversification is key,\u201d said Kyte. \u201cThe speed with which previously oil-dependent countries embrace diversification will be a factor in how well they thrive during the energy transition that is now underway.\u201d It won\u2019t be easy for the Gulf to wean itself off of fossil fuels. In a report released earlier this month, the Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation, a multilateral development bank, said the Gulf Cooperation Council states need to add 69 GW of electrical production to their current total capacity of 148 GW in the next five years to meet demand. Member states currently rely on hydrocarbon exports for 80 percent of their revenue. The global collapse in oil prices has rocked the region, which lost $287 billion in oil export income \u2013 almost 21 percent of GDP \u2013 in 2015, according to the International Monetary Fund. But experts say the sunny region is in a prime position to use renewable energy \u2013 particularly solar power \u2013 both to meet its own energy needs and bring in much-needed revenue. The region already has some of the infrastructure it needs to become a major clean-power hub. The Gulf Cooperation Council countries are linked by a 1,200-km electrical grid, built to help provide backup power in case of a blackout in one part of the system. Expanded to other countries, that electricity highway could be the backbone of future power trading, experts say. \u201cThe Gulf has an exportable resource in solar energy that could eventually be on a comparable level to oil and gas,\u201d said Jonathan Walters, a former director at the World Bank. \u201cLow oil prices might impel Gulf countries to find alternative exports,\u201d he said. And if prices rise again, domestic use of solar could soar, he said. Experts said they hope the rest of the Gulf States will look to the UAE as an example of how to tap into clean energy\u2019s potential. \u201cLow oil prices \u2026 and the need for clean air and secure supply chains of food and water all reinforce the wisdom of the UAE in taking a long-term view and moving to be a leader in renewable energy and energy productivity,\u201d Kyte said. \u201cNow we hope the UAE can share its lessons in the GCC and across the developing world,\u201d she said.

Supporters watch on as the fire rips through Bradford City 's ground - and have had no definitive answers to questions they asked .

Mark Lawn , the co-chairman of Bradford City , said : \u2018 I am personally delighted that the FA , the Football League and Premier League have got involved . I would like to remind people that the PSBRU is solely reliant on charitable donations by the public , charitable organisations and businesses , and has no funding from the Government . \u2018 I am extremely pleased that Bradford City has helped to fund the PSBRU through the supporters raising money . This has been enough over the years to help maintain and exceed the standards coming from the unit. \u2019 There are harrowing stories of almost entire families passing away that day in Yorkshire and serious questions still remain as we head into a fourth decade since the tragedy . They are laid bare in Martin Fletcher \u2019 s new book , Fifty-Six \u2013 The Story of the Bradford Fire , in which the author challenges accepted theories as to the cause . Nobody has been made accountable for events which saw Fletcher lose his brother Andrew , 11 , his father John , 34 , his uncle Peter , 32 , and his grandfather Eddie , 63 . Fletcher has been researching the fire for 15 years and believes the investigation \u2019 s findings are flawed . The inquiry asserted that the cause was , in all likelihood , down to a cigarette or a match dropped on to a pile of rubbish . He found that former chairman Stafford Heginbotham , who died in 1995 aged 61 , had been connected with at least eight other business fires and insurance claims . John Helm , the man commentating on the game when fire broke out , was candid in Sportsmail last week . Thousands watched on horrified as the flames took control of the stand to devastating effect . The variance in theories suggests , as with Hillsborough , a new investigation would be vindicated , offering potential closure for the city . Martin Fletcher \u2019 s new book \u2013 Fifty-six \u2013 The Story of the Bradford Fire \u2013 challenges accepted theories as to the cause of the fire . There were many cases of heroism , with more than fifty people receiving police awards or commendations . John Helm , the man commentating on the game when fire broke out , was candid in Sportsmail last week and refuted Fletcher \u2019 s claims . \u2018 Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind \u2014 any bitterness would be understandable \u2014 but from everything I have been told there isn \u2019 t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately , \u2019 he wrote . \u2018 On the contrary , I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started . Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire . \u2018 This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner . He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man , visiting this country from Australia , but his name was never revealed . \u2018 Without making allegations against the club \u2019 s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham , there is inference by implication in the book \u2014 with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham . As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day , and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later , it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson. \u2019 A solitary bottle of champagne stands on the terrace - Bradford had been celebrating winning the Third Division title earlier in the day .

Then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and husband Denis lay a wreath near a turnstile where many of the victims were found . The variance in theories suggests , as with Hillsborough , a new investigation would be vindicated , offering closure to a city that still has no definitive answer . This weekend will be the first time the whole of English football has come together and remembered the Bradford 56 in unison . And the club has only recently wanted to fully remember the victims publicly . The memorial at Valley Parade wasn \u2019 t erected until 2001 and years went by without the anniversary even getting a mention in programmes and there were no silences or black armbands . \u2018 I do feel we missed something of an opportunity in the aftermath of the fire , \u2019 former chairman Jack Tordoff said in 2011 , when Valley Parade celebrated its 125 years as a sporting venue . \u2018 I think we should have looked at starting from scratch in another location .

        "premise": "San Antonio city officials have messed with the wrong Texas chef . Attorney-turned-cook and activist Joan Cheever has spent the past decade feeding the homeless from the back of her charity food truck , until earlier this month she was slapped with a $ 2,000 fine for her charitable efforts . Cheever founded The Chow Train non-profit organization in 2005 , preparing hot meals in her licensed mobile kitchen and serving them at city parks out of her personal pickup , which she has been using as a delivery truck because it is more maneuverable . Punished for compassion : On April 7 , San Antonio police officers issued a fine to local chef and activist Joan Cheever ( right ) for feeding the homeless at Maverick Park . Wrong truck : Cheever , the founder of The Chow Train non-profit food truck , was serving hot meals out of her personal pickup truck because it is more compact . No permit : Cheever 's mobile kitchen is commercially licensed , but her personal vehicle is not . Hefty sum : Mrs Cheever was issued a citation and a $ 2,000 fine for failure to serve food out of a licensed food truck . Mixed messages : After writing out the citation , the officers allowed Cheever and her volunteers to continue distributing the meals . On April 7 , Cheever and her band of volunteers were dishing out free food to those in need at Maverick Park on the outskirts of San Antonio when she was approached by four police officers on bicycles . Speaking to ABC News , Cheever said she asked the cops , \u2018 What 's the problem ? ' and they replied , 'You . ' After a brief exchange with the SAPD cops , Mrs Cheever was issued a citation and a $ 2,000 fine for failure to serve food out of a licensed food truck . After writing out the ticket , Cheever said the officers gave her the green light to continue distributing meals . San Antonio city officials stated that Cheever was cited for \u2018 failing to adhere to long-standing regulations that are in place to ensure public health and safety. \u2019 City spokeswoman Di Galvan told ABC that mobile food establishment permits are not transferable from one vehicle to another . But the hefty fine has done nothing to deter the plucky Good Samaritan from carrying out her mission to provide much-needed sustenance to the city 's poor . Her meals usually consist of a vegetable soup , a main course , such as meatball or coq au vin , and a dessert . Since her April 7 run-in with the law , the chef has offered meals on two separate occasions at the park , each time drawing larger than usual crowds of supporters . No letter of apology : Cheever received this official letter from the city summoning her to court June 23 . Cooking up kindness : Cheever is an attorney and a trained chef who started her Chow Train charity in 2005 . Good Samaritans : Cheever and her band of volunteers have served hundreds of thousands of hot meals to those in need in San Antonio and other areas . \u2018 I came back to the park the following Tuesday and was met with 100 people who had candles and signs , \u2019 Cheever said . \u2018 This isn \u2019 t only about The Chow Train . It \u2019 s about every non-profit and every person who wants to do a good thing , but are intimidated by the $ 2,000 fine and possible arrest . So we \u2019 re just going to keep rolling on. \u2019 Cheever has retained the services of a lawyer to fight the citation . ' I \u2019 m not going to settle and I \u2019 m not going to pay the fine and I \u2019 m not going to stop , ' a defiant Mrs Cheever declared . \u2018 They can come out every Tuesday and write me up a ticket and we \u2019 ll just start collecting them. \u2019 Joan Cheever , a wife and mother , had graduated from a culinary school and was featured on celebrity cook Rachel Ray 's daytime talk show . Besides offering gourmet meals to low-income residents of San Antonio , Cheever and her group of helpers also have delivered meals to victims of natural disasters in places like Joplin , Missouri , and Moore , Oklahoma , which were ravaged by tornadoes recently . Cheever said it was insulting to her as a licensed cook that the city of San Antonio was treating her as a danger to the community . Religious freedom : Cheever accused police and city officials of violating her freedom of religion because she considers cooking and feeding the poor a free exercise of her faith . Defiant : Cheever pans to fight the citation and even possibly sue the city for violating the 1999 Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act . The Chow Train founder is scheduled to go before a judge June 23 . Cheever said she is prepared to invoke the 1999 Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act , saying she has the right to feed the homeless because she considers it a free exercise of her faith . Cheever said as much to Officer Mike Marotta as he was writing out the ticket to her April 7 . \u2018 One of the police officers said , \u201c Ma \u2019 am , if you want to pray , go to church , \u201d and I said , \u201c This is how I pray . When I cook this food and deliver it to the people who are less fortunate , \u2019 Cheever told News 4 San Antonio . Cheever is now considering suing the city for infringing upon her freedom of religion . The San Antonio City Council \u2019 s Quality of Life committee held a meeting Tuesday to address the controversy surrounding Cheever 's citation , saying that their goal is to protect the homeless from unsafe food , reported San Antonio Express News . But Cheever argued that she been distributing food in plain sight week after week for years , and local officers would pass by and wave at her . Some of them , according to the chef , even accepted meals from her . Besides offering gourmet meals to low-income residents of San Antonio , Cheever and her group of helpers also have delivered meals to victims of natural disasters in places like Joplin , Missouri , and Moore , Oklahoma , which were ravaged by tornadoes recently . Rep , Joaquin Castro , a Democrat representing San Antonio , has weighed in on the hot-button issue , calling on the City Council to \u2018 do right by Joan Cheever \u2019 and \u2018 allow her to feed the homeless. \u2019 This is the latest example of an ongoing nationwide crackdown on Good Samaritans offering help to the homeless . Last year , a 90-year-old pastor and World War II veteran was arrested twice in a single week for feeding the needy in Fort Lauderdale , Florida . According to a recent report by the National Coalition for the Homeless cited by the Washington Post , 71 cities across the US have either passed or proposed an ordinance that clamps down on feeding the homeless . Cheever has launched a GoFundMe campaign asking for donations towards her legal battle with the City of San Antonio . As of Wednesday night , Cheever 's supporters have contributed nearly $ 10,000 to her war chest .",

        "premise": "Michael Conlan was on the verge of pulling out of his must-win bout in the World Series of Boxing before opting to fight and claiming a dramatic win to book his place at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games alongside team-mate Paddy Barnes . Both Belfast boxers ( bronze medallists at London 2012 ) , were in action for the Italia Thunder franchise in Venezuela on Saturday night , with the pair needing victories to book flights to Rio . Barnes delivered in style , extending his undefeated WSB record this season to 7-0 with a split-decision points win over native light-flyweight Yoel Finol . Michael Conlan has booked his Olympic place after results went his way in Venezuela on Saturday night . The two-time Olympic medallist dropped his opponent in the first round en route to claiming a 49-45 victory on two of the judges \u2019 cards while the remaining judge questionably scored the fight 48-47 in Finol \u2019 s favour . The spilt-decision win was enough to help Barnes top the 49kg WSB rankings , with the Ardoyne native leapfrogging Uzbekistan \u2019 s Hasanboy Dusmatov to claim the only Olympic qualification spot on offer through the competition . Conlan \u2019 s mission was a far more complex affair , however . Not only did the Falls Road fighter need to win \u2014 which he did , earning a 49-46 unanimous points win over Venezuelan opponent Jos\u00e9 Vicente Azocar \u2014 but he also had to rely on a shock result elsewhere . The 23-year-old leapt to No 2 in the WSB bantamweight rankings , claiming the second 56kg Olympic spot on offer thanks to his win and the fact that Azerbaijan \u2019 s Magomed Gurbanov lost to Luis Mora Hector Garcia in Puerto Rico . Garcia had Gurbanov down in the fifth and final round of their bout as the Puerto Rican became a cult hero for Irish boxing , akin to Scottish footballer Gary Mackay who booked a place at Euro \u2019 88 for Jack Charlton \u2019 s Ireland side thanks to a goal against Bulgaria . The domino effect left Conlan in shock . The Belfast bantamweight was close to pulling out in frustration at his qualification limbo , and had all but made up his mind to turn professional in the near future before a dramatic U-turn . Conlan \u2019 s brother , Jamie , himself a promising professional boxer , was just one of the confidantes who contacted him to convince him to fight . Coaches Billy Walsh and John Conlan ( Michael \u2019 s father ) also played key roles in helping the boxer into the ring , continuing their sterling efforts throughout the competition . Both Conlan and Barnes won bronze at London 2012 , and will now represent Ireland again in Rio . \u2018 It hasn \u2019 t sunk it yet . I couldn \u2019 t believe it . I wasn \u2019 t really up for it [ the fight ] at all because I didn \u2019 t think the Azeri would lose , \u2019 said Conlan , speaking exclusively to Sportsmail . \u2018 I was thinking about pulling out [ on Friday ] . If I had \u2019 ve pulled out I would have been shattered now , lucky enough I didn \u2019 t . \u2018 If I hadn \u2019 t have qualified , I would have turned professional . I couldn \u2019 t be bothered going to [ qualify through ] the European Games after going through all of this . \u2018 When I got out of the ring , Paddy ran over and jumped on me and shouted , \u201c you \u2019 ve qualified \u201d and I said \u201c you \u2019 re lying to me , stop lying to me ! \u201d I nearly felt like crying , I just couldn \u2019 t believe it. \u2019 Conlan dedicated the result and his achievements to his girlfriend , Shauna and four-week old daughter , Luisne . \u2018 I really wanted to qualify to have time with her and my kid . I \u2019 ve been looking forward to doing the night feeds and all ! The main reason I \u2019 ve done this is for her , I \u2019 m just so happy it all paid off. \u2019 Barnes , meanwhile , has created history by becoming the first Irish boxer ever to qualify for three Olympics .

        "premise": "PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi missed the boat on immune system-boosting cancer drugs. Now it\u2019s trying to catch up. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Sanofi is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau The French drugmaker has hired John Reed, the former top scientist at oncology market leader Roche to head its group research operations. And it is now focusing on a pipeline of 10 medicines that it hopes will help it get a piece of the $100 billion-a-year cancer drug market. Dmitri Wiederschain, head of Sanofi\u2019s immuno-oncology research, acknowledged the company had failed to capitalize on the takeoff of immunotherapy - drugs that activate the body\u2019s immune system to attack tumor cells - in the early 2010s. But he said the group could now gain an edge in the next waves of immunotherapy treatments, which include combining different drugs to better target cancer. \u201cIt is of course a very competitive space but we now have \u2018foundation assets\u2019 to form a better rationale for combinations,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview, citing immunotherapy approaches known as PD-1, TGFBeta and the antibody CD38. \u201cIf you look across the biopharmaceutical landscape, Sanofi is the only company which has all three assets in its own pipeline or partnered with Regeneron,\u201d Wiederschain said. Sanofi teamed with U.S firm Regeneron in 2007 to increase its presence in biotech medicine. Immunotherapy is the fastest-growing part of the cancer drug segment, with sales expected to top $25 billion-a-year by 2021, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. Frederic Ponchon, a manager at Sycomore Asset Management which holds 6.7 million Sanofi shares, said the French company was unlikely to rival cancer leaders like Switzerland\u2019s Roche and U.S. firm Merck & Co soon. \u201cThey could enjoy occasional breakthroughs but it won\u2019t carry a lot of weight in their overall sales,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see that Sanofi takes cancer seriously but you must remember R&D cycles are very long. So I would say Sanofi won\u2019t be a great player in oncology but it may have some successes from time to time.\u201d Sanofi\u2019s main business areas include drugs for diabetes, heart diseases and vaccines, with cancer treatments making up only about 4 percent of sales. Its cancer drug sales totaled $1.7 billion last year, compared with Roche\u2019s $25.9 billion. Sanofi has not always been behind the curve in oncology; in the 1990s, it produced top-selling cancer drugs such as Taxotere and Eloxatin. However it has been seven years since the company launched its last one, Zaltrap, which targets metastatic colorectal cancer and had sales of 75 million euros ($87 million) last year. In the meantime, companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co have developed their immunotherapy blockbusters. New treatments, if successful, can fetch more than $100,000 a year. In Sanofi\u2019s current cancer pipeline, only one has made it to regulatory review in the United States and the European Union: immunotherapy agent cemiplimab to treat cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Regeneron is its partner on the project. The company expects to submit for U.S. regulatory review another of its cancer candidates, isatuximab, to treat multiple myeloma later this year or in early 2019. With over 2,000 drugs in the cancer immunotherapy space, the competitive landscape has never been more crowded as each firm seeks its own proprietary version of often similar drugs. \u201cThere is clearly huge market potential but also a very large number of players, it is the toughest issue here,\u201d Nicolas Baudouin, a director at ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s said of immunotherapy. Many of the immunotherapy drugs work in only a minority of patients, which companies hope to improve by combining drugs that target tumors in different ways. This area, where Sanofi says it can be successful, has proven a challenge for drugmakers so far. Earlier this year, a study showed an experimental drug developed by U.S Incyte had failed to bolster the effectiveness of Merck\u2019s blockbuster Keytruda to treat skin cancer patients. Roche also failed a key combination trial last month in colorectal cancer. Wiederschain said molecular oncology, which targets a tumor based on its genetic makeup, would also be a future differentiator. \u201cIt is about understanding better what drives the growth of cancer tissues, how the cells works and proliferation in the body.\u201d This has led Sanofi to launch early-stage trials in breast cancer using molecular oncology technology. Newly appointed research chief Reed will start the job on July 1, when industry veteran Elias Zerhouni retires. Under Zerhouni\u2019s leadership, Sanofi has tried to improve research and development productivity but still struggled to find enough new products to offset the impact of weak diabetes drug sales. It has also been looking to acquisitions to fill its pipeline. It struck two big deals in January, agreeing to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Belgium\u2019s Ablynx, which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, for 3.9 billion euros.

        "premise": "China\u2019s growing middle class has staggeringly high expectations when it comes to how much money they will need for retirement. A recent report from insurer AIA says mainland Chinese residents believe, on average, they require $US1.79 million for a comfortable retirement. Those surveyed in larger tier-one cities believe they will require $1.94 million, while those living in smaller tier-two cities expect they\u2019ll need $1.64 million. The research was conducted for AIA by respected social research firm Ipsos. The mind-bogglingly large figures are significantly greater than what people in many developed nations believe is required for life after stopping work. For comparison, in Australia, industry estimates say an Australian couple with no welfare entitlements will need around $US750,000, or just over $A1 million, to fund a comfortable retirement. The Chinese expectation is even more difficult to fathom when set against the current average savings rate in China. According to the survey, respondents are currently saving on average $US1,036 per month. While a large proportion compared to average average salary, it would take 143 years to reach the target level. When you take into account the $US255,915 average level of liquid assets currently held by survey respondents, excluding property, the number of years of saving required to reach $US1.79 million falls to a mere 123 years. While this figure doesn\u2019t take into consideration property assets \u2013 91% of survey respondents declared that they are already homeowners with 69% of those indicating that they have already paid off their mortgage in full \u2013 it still suggests expectations for retirement compared to actual wealth and the savings rate are chasms apart. This is where the stock market comes in. The huge lifestyle expectations in retirement may be forcing China\u2019s middle-class into investments that offer greater returns, such as stocks. But of course this comes with greater risks. One of the key findings of the AIA report was that many middle-class Chinese approaching retirement are actively investing in more complex financial assets such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The AIA report said, with emphasis added: \u201cAs part of retirement planning, many of the middle class in Mainland China are active financial planners. Many of those saving for retirement are investing in equities, bonds or mutual funds (73%) \u2013 the highest percentage that are doing so among any of the North Asian markets surveyed. This is also a sizeable increase compared with the 57% of the middle class in Mainland China who were investing in equities in the 2013 survey\u201d. Clearly the government\u2019s desire to push investors into the nation\u2019s stock market is having an effect, and may be amplifying risk-taking among China\u2019s middle-class in order to achieve their retirement goals. What\u2019s more, survey respondents, perhaps lulled into a false sense of security given the government\u2019s relentless efforts to underpin gains in China\u2019s stock market, expressed a distinct lack of concern towards their ability to fund a comfortable retirement. Only 25% of respondents suggested they were worried about saving enough for retirement. This compared to 45% of responses across the broader north Asia region. So China\u2019s middle-class, based on this survey, have huge expectations for their wealth in retirement, are unconcerned about being able to reach their retirement goals, and are pouring money into higher-yielding but riskier asset classes. While this survey was conducted prior to the recent market rout in China\u2019s stock market, it offers an insight as to why the government, regulators, and even the police, have unleashed a vast array of unprecedented measures designed to support stock prices in recent weeks. Quite simply, China\u2019s huge and growing middle-class has a lot riding on its success. Site highlights each day to your inbox.

Heather Mack , 19 , who gave birth to her own daughter just weeks ago , was found guilty with her 21-year-old boyfriend , Tommy Schaefer , of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack on the Indonesian island last August . Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort . Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend 's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple 's relationship . The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort . They told the driver they 'd be back soon , but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag , noticed blood and called police . The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers ( nine miles ) away . Inside the bag , von Wiese-Mack 's body had been wrapped in hotel bedding . A forensic examination determined that she had died from a blunt force to the face that fractured her facial bones and caused her to suffocate . Described as a Chicago socialite , von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter . Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated .

'The sport is continuing to improve and I need to continue to improve . 'There 's challenges this season that I would love to accomplish , which do n't necessarily mean going to a race and winning . 'Last year in Argentina I was in second and almost passed the reigning Olympic champion ( Latvia 's Maris Strombergs ) for the win . 'That 's something I feel I 'd like a little bit more exposure to - not being out in front and having to try to pass some of the best guys to come back and win .

Phillips knows his performances in recent seasons mean he is a key rival others will do anything to beat . ' I do have a target on me , because I have performed at a high level over the last few years and I have been world champion , ' he added . 'Last year 's World Championships was so frustrating because I sacrificed doing a few races before then because I wanted to chuck everything at retaining that title . ' I was absolutely flying and I know that given the opportunity to continue racing I would certainly have been more than capable of retaining that , but that 's BMX . 'It 's just the nature of it .

Phillips failed to defend his title last year , but is determined to take it back this July in Belgium . He added : ' I look back at the World Cup last year and I 've never experienced pressure like that . Being reigning world champion , everybody expects you to win . 'There 's 150 guys in the race , but everybody is looking at this as my race . It 's something I seem to be able to manage and thrive on in some respects .

        "premise": "The Northwest Airlines jet that crashed Sunday in Detroit, killing at least 154 people, was involved in two incidents of engine failure in the past two years. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-82 jet made emergency landings in 1985 and 1986 following the loss of power in one of its two engines. A Northwest spokesman confirmed that the incidents happened, but said they weren't related to Sunday's crash of Flight 255. Though federal investigators were looking into a number of possible causes for the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff, engine failure appeared to be a likely culprit. According to Associated Press reports, some witnesses to the crash, including an air traffic controller, said they saw blue flame coming from one of the jetliner's engines just before it hit the ground and exploded into a fireball. The accident, the second-deadliest ever in the U.S., could have a broad range of effects on the airline industry regardless of the specific causes, aviation specialists said. Following a summer of near-misses, delays and other snafus, some airline specialists said the accident could serve as a catalyst for a reassessment of the nation's air-travel system. Unlike the recent near-misses, the Detroit accident doesn't appear related to air-traffic control problems. Even so, some congressional aides believe there will be a \"spillover\" effect, and that all aviation safety issues will now get closer scrutiny. Moreover, although service problems have been the focus of much of the attention in recent months, the debate may now center more strongly on safety issues. \"There is going to be a lot of noise from Capitol Hill,\" said John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute. \"This one is going under the microscope.\" Added a Senate Commerce Committee staff member: \"Delays and other consumer concerns will end up in the back seat.\" In Detroit, federal crash inspectors and representatives of United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, the engine maker, arrived at the accident scene. Officials said that the aircraft's flight recorders, which record cockpit conversations, had been found in wreckage that extended over half a mile. The MD-82 jet, which has a good safety record, is designed to be able to take off and land even if one engine fails. Safety officials wouldn't speculate on whether the plane's heavy load may have contributed to the crash. In addition to a large fuel load for the flight to Phoenix, Ariz., the flight was jammed with passengers. There were 153 people on a plane with 143 passenger seats. The extras included six crew members, two babies who were being held by passengers and two Northwest employees riding on two of the plane's jump seats. Wire-service reports said two persons on the ground also were killed, and that a 4-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition. Late last night, the Associated Press reported that the girl was identified by her grandfather. Her father, mother and brother were passengers on the Northwest airliner and died in the crash. The JT8D-219 engines used on the jet have been the subject of some concern among federal safety officals. In April, the National Transportation Safety Board urged the FAA to conduct a safety investigation of the 200 series of JT8D engines after some dangerous in-flight engine failures. The board made the recommendation after a March 23 incident in which an American Airlines MD-82 plane approaching the Minneapolis airport experienced an engine surge and loss of power. The engine, a JT8D-217A, was shut down, and the plane landed without further trouble. A later inspection showed that all 44 of the pins used to lock jet-engine turbine-vane clusters to the outer part of the turbine case had fractured. The board recommended that the FAA order inspections of the JT8D engines to detect any pin fractures and to replace existing ones with improved pins. The board said similar incidents involved Pacific Southwest Airlines and Muse Airlines. The FAA, in a May 29 response, told the board it essentially agreed with its recommendations and would take steps to require inspections of the engine and replacement of parts where necessary. The new rules, proposed last month, will go into effect this fall, FAA officials said. In its April report, the National Transportation Safety Board warned that \"many\" of the 330 MD-80 series airplanes operated by 12 U.S. and 14 foreign airlines world-wide \"are potential candidates\" for engine failure. More than 900 of the engines have been manufactured, according to the board. However, engineering changes have been made in some engines. In others, airlines have made changes, based on a Pratt &amp; Whitney service bulletin, to reduce the risk of pin failure. Thomas Haueter, of the safety recommendations staff of the safety agency, said that the board hadn't put out an emergency recommendation for immediate replacement of the pins because it was unclear if the problems that had occurred were merely isolated incidents or reflected system problems. FAA officials at the crash scene wouldn't speculate on the reasons for the crash or comment on the plane's engines. John Lauber, one of five members of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a news conference at a hotel near the airport last night that there was no evidence at this point that either engine exploded or caught fire during flight. He stressed that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions. A board spokesman said it will take nine to 12 months to determine the probable cause of the accident. Despite an excellent safety record, Northwest could be hurt in a number of ways by the crash. Among other things, the accident has focused attention on its recent service problems as well as discord among its workers. The airline early yesterday denied that its labor troubles may have played a role in the crash. Such concerns arose following reports of a work slowdown by Northwest mechanics. In January, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating incidents of alleged tampering with Northwest planes in Minneapolis. Northwest, a unit of Minneapolis-based NWA Inc., also has had a rash of service problems since its acquisition of Republic Airlines last year. There were reports yesterday that relatives of crash victims being flown in from Phoenix were asked to switch from one Northwest jet to another because of mechanical problems. The MD-82 that crashed was a former Republic jet that Northwest acquired as part of the merger. The two emergency landings that involved the jetliner, number N312RC, took place in Minneapolis and San Francisco. In the Minneapolis incident, the plane landed missing part of its tail cone. A Northwest spokesman said the engines involved in those two incidents had since been replaced by other JT8D-200 series engines. The FAA said in Washington that air-traffic controllers in Detroit gave the Northwest flight takeoff clearance for Runway 3C, the center of the airport's three runways. The controllers reported that shortly after the jetliner lifted off, it pitched from left to right, according to FAA spokesman John Leyden. Then they \"saw a blue flash from the left engine,\" Mr. Leyden said. \"The left wing hit the ground, and the aircraft burst into flames,\" according to the controllers' account. FAA records show that besides those incidents that involved the plane that crashed, problems with the turbine sections of JT8D-200 series engines occurred on three Republic flights in the past four years. None of those problems resulted in a serious accident. In one such incident, in September 1983, falling debris from an engine caused fire damage to several homes around John Wayne International Airport in Orange County, Calif. In another incident, at the Detroit airport in October 1985, an engine on an MD-82 \"popped and began to unspool\" on takeoff. Later inspection revealed extensive turbine damage to the engine, the FAA report said. An FAA official said all jetliners, in order to be certified, must be capable of completing their takeoff ascent even if one engine fails, provided the aircraft is within prescribed weight limits. Why the Northwest airliner failed to make the climb and whether it was carrying too much weight will be subjects for federal investigators, he said. Congress is expected to act on a half-dozen major aviation bills this fall. Staff members now expect those bills to attract new measures aimed at improving safety. \"Aviation is going to be a hot topic,\" said an aide to Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). \"When people get back (from their August recess), they will be looking for an opportunity to do something.\" For example, Sen. Byrd and Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, have already drawn up legislation that would require small planes to be equipped with altitude-reporting devices at hundreds of airports across the U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, predicted that the accident will \"accelerate movement by the Congress and the Transportation Department to do whatever can be done -- either by hiring more maintenance inspectors or reducing air traffic to meet the capacity of the system, to reduce the chances of future accidents.\" He added, \"We will want to hear a thorough examination of everything that took place with that airplane and what was going on at the airport.\" Sunday's crash was the first time in 24 years that passengers were killed in an accident involving a Northwest plane. In June 1963, a DC-7 operating as a military charter crashed into the Pacific Ocean, killing all 101 people onboard. In March, a commuter plane affiliated with Northwest crashed in Detroit, killing nine people. The worst airline accident ever in the U.S. was the 1979 crash of an American Airlines jet in Chicago. --- Previous Airline Accidents In U.S. Involving U.S. Carriers AIRLINE LOCATION YEAR DEATHS American Chicago 1979 273 Pan Am Kenner, La. 1982 153 PSA San Diego 1982 144 Delta Dallas 1985 135 TWA, United New York 1960 134 Eastern New York 1975 112 Alaska Juneau 1971 111 Eastern Miami 1972 99 American New York 1962 95 TWA Berryville, Va. 1974 92",

The Bionic Bar is among many hi-tech gimmicks on board the 4,180-passenger Anthem Of The Seas , Royal Caribbean 's second Quantum-class liner , which last week set sail on its maiden voyage . Passengers have rubber wristbands fitted with electronic chips , which can be pressed against various sensors .

This ship is clearly aimed at younger cruisers . The indoor SeaPlex activity area ( the largest of its kind at sea ) has bumper cars , a roller disco and circus school .

At the latter , my instructor tells me to thrust out my hips to avoid spinning out of control . In my post-\u00adskydive photo , the instructor has two arms around my bottom and his face in my chest - and I look as though I 've had a bad facelift . The Anthem 's 18 restaurants include a hotdog-\u00adfilled food truck and a Johnny Rockets American diner . For now , Anthem Of The Seas will remain on this side of the pond , exploring Western Europe from her home port of Southampton . In October , she will cross the Atlantic before spending the winter cruising the Caribbean . Which gives the robotic bartender plenty of time to perfect his margarita\u00ad mixing skills .

        "premise": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now the third-largest digital ad sales platform in the U.S. -- behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- according to new data from eMarketer. The e-commerce company is expected to take 4.1% of U.S. digital ad spending this year, amounting to $4.61 billion in ad sales. This puts the online retail giant ahead of Oath (a Verizon subsidiary) and Microsoft for the first time. The company's climb up the advertising ladder this year has a very small asterisk next to it, as eMarketer said, \"It's important to note that much of that growth is thanks to an accounting change Amazon made that affected estimates for 2018 and later, leading to the growth spike this year.\" Image source: Getty Images. But that doesn't mean Amazon isn't legitimately growing into an advertising powerhouse. Companies spent 165% more for sponsored product ads on Amazon (which are displayed at the top of search results on the e-commerce site) in the second quarter of this year than they did a year ago, according to the marketing firm Merkle. Amazon's advertising growth is likely just getting started. The company's platform will account for an estimated 7% of all U.S. digital ad sales by 2020. Of course, this is all good news for Amazon. But why does it matter for the company and its investors? Because Amazon's advertising business could soon become even more lucrative than its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment. One of Amazon's most profitable businesses over the past few years has been AWS. The cloud computing platform brought in $1.64 billion in operating income in the most recent quarter, and sales from the segment accounted for 11.5% of Amazon's top line. Additionally, Amazon holds the No. 1 position in cloud infrastructure market share, with about 33% of the market. That's important, because the cloud market will be worth $302.5 billion by 2021, up from $153.5 billion in 2017, according to Gartner. But as important and lucrative as AWS is, Amazon's recent increase in ad sales and profits could become even more important to its business over the next few years. Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in August that Amazon's advertising operating income would grow to $16 billion in 2021 and outpace the company's AWS operating income of $15 billion that year. \"Investors should be focused on Amazon advertising now; this is a major driver to results and valuation today and continuing in the coming quarters & years,\" Olson said. Olson's estimate doesn't seem so far off base when you consider that Amazon is expected to reach $22 billion in ad revenue by 2022. Amazon's potential to make its advertising business bigger than AWS comes in part from the fact that online shoppers are going directly to Amazon's site to search for products, instead of using Google. About 55% of all online shoppers now head straight to Amazon to search for products, up from 44% last year. As Amazon's e-commerce platform increasingly becomes the initial go-to destination for online shoppers, advertisers will continue to increase their spending on the company's site. And if the above estimates pan out, then Amazon's advertising business could overtake AWS profits in just a few years. Amazon investors (or potential ones) should take note of Amazon's rising significance in the advertising market. While it's natural to compare the company's advertising market share unfavorably to Facebook and Google's dominance, it's important not to get caught up in measuring the three with the same stick. Amazon is building out a third, and already lucrative, pillar of its business that will be a nice addition to its e-commerce and cloud computing segments. The company doesn't have to beat Google and Facebook in advertising sales; it just has to continue taking a little bit of market share away from them. The 4% of the U.S. digital advertising market that Amazon has right now is already boosting its profit. A small increase in that percentage over the next few years would do even more good for Amazon's bottom line. Investors should strongly consider adding Amazon's advertising business into their investing thesis for the company. Between Amazon's dominance in the e-commerce world, its lead in cloud computing, and now its lucrative and fast-growing advertising business, this company looks better than ever before.

        "premise": "The cockpit voice recorder of the Lion Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in October, killing 189 people, has been found, an Indonesian official has said. Navy divers used specialised equipment to find the device under eight metres of seabed mud. The Lion Air jet, crashed into waters 30 metres deep. Ridwan Djamaluddin, a deputy maritime minister, told reporters on Monday the National Transportation Safety Committee had informed the ministry about the discovery. He said human remains were also discovered at the seabed location in the waters of Tanjung Karawang on Monday morning. The two-month-old Boeing 737 Max 8 jet operated by the Indonesian budget airline plunged into the sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta on 29 October, killing all on board. The CVR, which records conversations between the pilots, co-pilots and air traffic control, is believed to hold vital clues into the fatal crash. Indonesian aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said the finding was \u201ccrucial\u201d because it would allow investigators to understand \u201cwhat was going on in the heads of the pilots during the flight\u201d. The pilots of the downed plane had requested to turn back two minutes after taking off for Pangkal Pinang, before losing contact with air traffic control. It is unclear in what condition the black box was found but analyst Soejatman said there were various methods to recover the CVR data. Luhut Pandjaitan, the maritime and fisheries minister, told the Jakarta Post he hoped the discovery would bring more clarity to the investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s very good progress. I think the information in the box might make things clear,\u201d he said. The first black box to be recovered, the flight data recorder (FDR), was discovered days after the crash. A preliminary report by Indonesian authorities released in November showed there had been problems with the jet\u2019s airspeed indicator, with the mechanism malfunctioning on the last four flights. In the days before the crash, an angle of attack sensor, which indicates whether a plane is going to stall, was also replaced. While the search for the second black box was resumed on 8 January, Indonesians officials had called off the search for the victims in late November. At the time, 196 body bags containing body parts had been recovered but only 125 victims had been identified, with the condition of the remains complicating the work of the police forensics team. Lion Air launched a multi-million dollar search effort in late December to continue the search for the remaining victims and second black box. The crash \u2013 the first of a Boeing 737 Max jet and the worst airline disaster in Indonesia in more than two decades, has also heightened concerns about the safety and maintenance operations of Lion Air \u2013 a budget airline that has expanded rapidly across south-east Asia over recent years.",
